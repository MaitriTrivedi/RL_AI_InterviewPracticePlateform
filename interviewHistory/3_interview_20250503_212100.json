    "answer": "In this social network context, a graph is a collection of nodes (representing users) and edges (representing friendships or connections between users). The nodes are the individual users, and the edges show how these users are connected, like a \"friendship\" or \"follow\" relationship.\n\nUndirected Graph:\nIn an undirected graph, the edges have no direction. This means that if User A is friends with User B, then User B is also friends with User A. The relationship is mutual.\n\nExample: If Alice is friends with Bob, it implies that Bob is also friends with Alice.\n\nDirected Graph:\nIn a directed graph, the edges have a direction, meaning the relationship goes one way. If User A follows User B, it doesn't necessarily mean User B follows User A.\n\nExample: If Alice follows Bob on the social network, it doesn't imply Bob follows Alice, unless there's a separate edge pointing from Bob to Alice.\n\nSummary:\nUndirected graph: Mutual friendships (e.g., Facebook).\n\nDirected graph: One-way relationships (e.g., Twitter follows).",

      "feedback": "The answer is excellent, providing a clear and accurate explanation of graphs, directed graphs, and undirected graphs within the context of a social network. The examples are relevant and easily understandable. The distinction between mutual friendships and one-way relationships is well-articulated. The use of Facebook and Twitter as examples is also a good way to illustrate the concepts. The response could be slightly improved by explicitly stating that a graph *consists of* a set of vertices/nodes and a set of edges.",

        "How would you represent different types of relationships (e.g., acquaintance vs. close friend) in a graph structure? Consider weighted edges.",
        "How would you determine the shortest path between two users in this social network graph? What algorithms could be used?"
