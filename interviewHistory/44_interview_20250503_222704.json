      "content": "When you browse a website, your computer sends a request to a server. Which layer of the OSI model is primarily responsible for ensuring this data is reliably transmitted between your computer and the server, handling things like error detection and retransmission if necessary?",

    "answer": "The **Transport layer (Layer 4)** of the OSI model is primarily responsible for ensuring reliable data transmission between your computer and the server.\n\n### Key Responsibilities of the Transport Layer:\n\n* **Error detection and correction**: It checks for errors in the data and handles retransmissions if any errors are detected.\n* **Reliability**: Protocols like **TCP** (Transmission Control Protocol) operate at this layer to provide reliable communication, ensuring that data is delivered in the correct order and without loss.\n* **Flow control**: It manages the rate of data transmission to prevent network congestion.\n\nIn summary, the Transport layer ensures that data is reliably transmitted between your computer and the server, handling issues like errors, retransmissions, and flow control.\n",
    "evaluation": {
      "score": 9,
      "feedback": "The answer is excellent and correctly identifies the Transport layer as responsible for reliable data transmission. It clearly explains the key responsibilities, including error detection and correction, reliability using TCP, and flow control. The response directly addresses the question and provides a concise and informative explanation. It could benefit slightly from explicitly mentioning connection-oriented vs connection-less aspects to solidify understanding. Overall, a very strong response.",
      "strengths": [
        "Accurately identifies the Transport Layer (Layer 4)",
        "Clearly explains the core responsibilities of the Transport Layer regarding reliable data transfer (error detection, retransmission, reliability)",
        "Mentions TCP as a key protocol at this layer",
        "Highlights the importance of flow control",
        "Well-structured and easy to understand"
      ],
      "areas_for_improvement": [
        "Could briefly differentiate between TCP (connection-oriented) and UDP (connection-less) at the Transport Layer, although the question focused on reliability.",
        "Could subtly mention segmentation/reassembly as a function of the transport layer."
      ],
      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Can you explain the difference between TCP and UDP in terms of reliability and use cases?",
        "How does the Transport layer handle out-of-order packets in TCP?",
        "Can you elaborate on how flow control mechanisms prevent network congestion?"
