      "subtopic": "CAP Theorem",
      "difficulty": 10.0,
      "content": "You are tasked with designing a globally distributed, multi-tenant key-value store. Each tenant requires strong consistency within their partition but can tolerate eventual consistency *between* partitions owned by the same tenant. Your architecture leverages a consensus protocol for consistency within a partition. However, due to unpredictable network partitions and the necessity to maintain availability for critical user-facing features, you've observed frequent occurrences where a tenant\u2019s partitions become temporarily isolated and experience a split-brain scenario despite the use of the consensus protocol. These splits result in data divergence between the isolated partitions. Describe a robust and cost-effective strategy to automatically detect and resolve such divergence, ensuring eventual consistency across all of a tenant\u2019s partitions. Your strategy must also consider potential for malicious or compromised nodes within the tenant's partitions attempting to manipulate the resolution process, and detail how you would mitigate this. Furthermore, consider the performance impact of your chosen solution on overall system latency and throughput, and explain how you would optimize it. Finally, how would you handle the edge case where a tenant is extremely large, spanning multiple regions, and experiences frequent, smaller network partitions that are constantly healing before full divergence can be detected?",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "How would your solution change if you also need to ensure causal consistency across all tenants, not just within a tenant's partitions?",
        "What metrics would you monitor to evaluate the effectiveness of your divergence detection and resolution strategy, and what are the acceptable thresholds for these metrics?"
