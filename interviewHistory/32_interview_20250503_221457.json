      "topic": null,
      "subtopic": "CPU Scheduling",
      "difficulty": 3.0,
      "content": "Imagine a simple operating system using First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) scheduling. Three processes, P1, P2, and P3, arrive in that order. P1 requires 5 units of CPU time, P2 requires 2 units, and P3 requires 3 units.  What is the average waiting time for these three processes?",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "What is one potential disadvantage of the FCFS scheduling algorithm?",
        "Under what circumstances would FCFS be a suitable choice for CPU scheduling?"
      ],
      "evaluation_points": [
        "Understanding of FCFS scheduling",
        "Ability to calculate waiting time for each process",
        "Calculation of average waiting time: (0 + 5 + 7)/3 = 4"

      "expected_time_minutes": 5
    },
    "answer": "FCFS Scheduling:\nProcess P1: Waits 0 units (since it arrives first).\n\nProcess P2: Waits 5 units (P1 finishes first).\n\nProcess P3: Waits 7 units (P1 and P2 finish first).\n\nAverage Waiting Time:\nAverage\u00a0Waiting\u00a0Time\n=\n0\n+\n5\n+\n7\n3\n=\n12\n3\n=\n4\n\u00a0units\n.\nAverage\u00a0Waiting\u00a0Time= \n3\n0+5+7\n\u200b\n = \n3\n12\n\u200b\n =4\u00a0units.",
    "evaluation": {
      "score": 10,
      "feedback": "The answer is completely correct and well-explained. The student demonstrates a clear understanding of FCFS scheduling, accurately calculates the waiting time for each process, and correctly computes the average waiting time. The breakdown of the waiting time for each process adds clarity to the solution.",
      "strengths": [
        "Correct application of FCFS scheduling.",
        "Accurate calculation of waiting times.",
        "Clear and concise explanation.",
        "Correct computation of average waiting time."

      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Consider exploring other scheduling algorithms like Shortest Job First (SJF) or Priority Scheduling.",
        "Think about the potential drawbacks of FCFS, such as its susceptibility to the convoy effect."
