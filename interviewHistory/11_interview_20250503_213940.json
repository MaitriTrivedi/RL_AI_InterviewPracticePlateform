      "content": "Imagine you are designing a simple website with three pages: a homepage (`/`), an about page (`/about`), and a contact page (`/contact`).  How does a router (either on the client-side in a framework like React or on the server-side) decide which content to display when a user navigates to `/about`?",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "What is a common way to define these routes in code?",
        "What happens if a user types in a URL that doesn't match any defined route?"
      ],
      "evaluation_points": [
        "The router matches the URL path (`/about`) against a defined set of routes.",
        "The router executes the associated logic (e.g., rendering the 'about' component or returning the 'about' page content)."
      ],
      "expected_time_minutes": 5
    },
    "answer": "A router decides which content to display by matching the URL path to predefined routes. When a user navigates to /about, the router checks its route definitions. If it finds a match (e.g., a route for /about), it displays the corresponding content or component (like the About page).\n\nClient-side (React): React Router listens for URL changes and renders the associated component for /about.\n\nServer-side: The server matches the request path (/about) to a route handler and returns the appropriate HTML for that page.\n\nIn both cases, the router maps the path to a specific piece of content or functionality.",

      "score": 8,
      "feedback": "The answer provides a good overview of how routing works on both the client-side and server-side. It correctly identifies the core mechanism of matching URL paths to predefined routes and executing the associated logic. However, it could benefit from a bit more detail, specifically regarding the types of matching and how parameters might be handled.",
      "strengths": [
        "Correctly identifies the core routing mechanism.",
        "Distinguishes between client-side and server-side routing.",
        "Clear and concise explanation."
      ],
      "areas_for_improvement": [
        "Could elaborate on different types of route matching (e.g., exact match, wildcard, parameters).",
        "The explanation is somewhat generic. Adding details about how parameters within a route are handled would enhance understanding."
      ],
      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Can you explain how route parameters are handled in either React Router or a server-side framework you're familiar with?",
        "What are some strategies for handling routes that don't match any defined path (e.g., 404 errors)?"
