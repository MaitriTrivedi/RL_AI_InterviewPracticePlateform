      "topic": null,
      "subtopic": "Joins",
      "difficulty": 2.0,
      "content": "You have two tables: `Customers` and `Orders`. `Customers` contains customer information (CustomerID, Name) and `Orders` contains order information (OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate). Explain what type of join you would use to retrieve all customers and their orders, including customers who haven't placed any orders yet.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "What is the difference between an INNER JOIN and the type of join you suggested?",
        "How would you write the SQL query for this join, assuming you are using standard SQL?"
      ],
      "evaluation_points": [
        "LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)",
        "The understanding that a LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the 'left' table (Customers in this case) even if there's no matching row in the 'right' table (Orders)."
      ],
      "expected_time_minutes": 5
    },
    "answer": "SELECT Customers.CustomerID, Customers.Name, Orders.OrderID, Orders.OrderDate\nFROM Customers\nLEFT JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;\n",
    "evaluation": {
      "score": 9,
      "feedback": "The answer is technically correct and provides the correct SQL query to retrieve all customers and their orders, including customers without any orders. The query utilizes a LEFT JOIN, which is the appropriate join type for the problem. The ON clause correctly joins the tables based on the CustomerID. The response demonstrates a solid understanding of LEFT JOINs and their application.",
      "strengths": [
        "Correct use of LEFT JOIN",
        "Accurate SQL syntax",
        "Addresses the core requirement of including customers without orders"
      ],
      "areas_for_improvement": [
        "Could briefly explain the rationale behind using a LEFT JOIN instead of other join types (e.g., INNER JOIN). While the code is correct, a slightly more detailed explanation would demonstrate a deeper understanding.",
        "Could mention how NULL values in the Orders table fields would indicate customers without orders."
      ],
      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Explain the differences between INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN, and when each is most appropriate.",
        "How would you modify this query to only return customers who *have* placed orders?"
