    "answer": "Caching is the process of storing copies of frequently accessed data in a temporary storage (cache) to reduce retrieval time and improve performance.\n\nIn web applications, caching is used to speed up response times by reducing the need to repeatedly fetch data from slower sources (like databases or external APIs). Common caching techniques include storing data in memory (e.g., Redis, Memcached) to serve repeated requests faster and reduce server load.",
    "evaluation": {
      "score": 8,
      "feedback": "The answer provides a good definition of caching and its purpose in web applications. It correctly identifies the core concept of storing frequently accessed data for faster retrieval and explains the performance benefits. Mentioning the reduction in server load is also a positive point. The answer also touches upon practical caching techniques like in-memory caching using tools like Redis and Memcached. However, the answer could be improved by elaborating on different levels of caching (e.g., browser caching, CDN caching, server-side caching) and different caching strategies (e.g., cache invalidation).",

        "Clearly defines caching and its purpose.",

      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Explain the different levels of caching that can be implemented in a web application architecture.",
        "Describe different caching strategies and when each one is most appropriate (e.g., Time-To-Live (TTL), Least Recently Used (LRU)).",
        "Discuss cache invalidation techniques and the challenges associated with maintaining cache consistency."
