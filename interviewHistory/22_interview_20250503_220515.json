      "topic": null,
      "subtopic": "IP Addressing",
      "difficulty": 3.0,
      "content": "You are setting up a small home network with a router. Your ISP provides you with a single public IP address. What is the primary reason why your router assigns private IP addresses (like 192.168.1.x) to the devices within your home network instead of using the single public IP address directly on each device?",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "What is the purpose of Network Address Translation (NAT) in this scenario?",
        "Give an example of a common private IP address range."
      ],
      "evaluation_points": [
        "Limited number of public IPv4 addresses",
        "NAT allows multiple devices to share a single public IP",
        "Security benefits of NAT (hiding internal IPs)"
      ],
      "expected_time_minutes": 3
    },
    "answer": "The primary reason is Network Address Translation (NAT). Your router assigns private IP addresses (like 192.168.1.x) to devices in your home network and uses NAT to translate those private IP addresses into the single public IP address when accessing the internet.\n\nThis allows multiple devices to share one public IP address, conserving public IP address space and enhancing security by keeping devices behind the router, which acts as a barrier between your internal network and the internet.",
    "evaluation": {
      "score": 9,
      "feedback": "This is an excellent answer. The student correctly identifies NAT as the primary reason and explains its function clearly. The answer also touches on both the IPv4 address exhaustion issue and the security benefits. It's concise and accurate.",
      "strengths": [
        "Correctly identifies NAT as the core mechanism.",
        "Clearly explains how NAT allows multiple devices to share a single public IP.",
        "Mentions both IP address conservation and security benefits.",
        "Concise and easy to understand."
      ],
      "areas_for_improvement": [
        "Could explicitly state the limited number of IPv4 addresses as a driving factor behind NAT's adoption.",
        "While mentioning security, could elaborate slightly on how NAT provides security (e.g., hiding the internal network structure from external view)."
      ],
      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Explain the difference between static NAT and dynamic NAT/PAT (Port Address Translation).",
        "How does NAT impact applications that rely on direct connections (e.g., online gaming, VoIP)? What solutions exist to address these challenges?"
