    "answer": "Encapsulation in object-oriented programming (OOP) is the concept of bundling the data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. It also involves restricting access to certain details of the object's implementation, exposing only the necessary parts through public methods (often called getters and setters). This helps protect the integrity of the data and provides a controlled interface for interacting with it.\n\nReal-World Analogy: TV Remote\nThink of a TV remote:\n\nThe buttons on the remote are the public methods that allow you to interact with the TV (turn it on/off, adjust volume, change channels).\n\nThe internal electronics (the circuits and mechanisms) that process your button presses are like the private data or implementation details inside the TV or remote.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to know how the electronics work to use the remote; you only interact with the buttons. This hides the complexity and protects the internal workings of the remote, just like encapsulation in OOP.\n\nIn essence, the TV remote provides a simple interface (buttons) to interact with a complex system (internal electronics), just as encapsulation hides the complexity of object data and exposes only what\u2019s necessary.",
    "evaluation": {
      "score": 9,
      "feedback": "The answer is excellent. It accurately and completely describes encapsulation, covering both the bundling of data and methods and the principle of information hiding. The TV remote analogy is well-chosen and clearly explains the concept of exposing a simple interface to a complex system. The explanation is easy to understand and directly relates to the core principles of encapsulation. Minor improvements could be made by explicitly mentioning the benefits of encapsulation, such as code maintainability and reduced dependencies.",

        "Can you explain how encapsulation contributes to code maintainability?",
        "Describe how access modifiers (public, private, protected) enforce encapsulation in a specific programming language."
