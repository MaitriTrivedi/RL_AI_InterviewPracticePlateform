      "content": "Imagine a simple system that needs to run three processes: A, B, and C. Process A needs 10 time units, Process B needs 5 time units, and Process C needs 2 time units. If the system uses a First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) scheduling algorithm and the processes arrive in the order A, B, then C, what is the average waiting time for all three processes?",

    "answer": "### FCFS Scheduling:\n\nIn **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)** scheduling, processes are executed in the order they arrive. The waiting time for a process is the time it has to wait before it starts executing.\n\n#### Steps to calculate waiting time:\n\n1. **Process A** arrives first and starts execution immediately. It has a waiting time of **0** units because it starts right away.\n2. **Process B** starts after Process A finishes. Process A needs 10 units, so Process B has to wait for 10 units before it starts. Therefore, the waiting time for Process B is **10** units.\n3. **Process C** starts after Process B finishes. Process B needs 5 units, so Process C has to wait for 10 + 5 = 15 units before it starts. Therefore, the waiting time for Process C is **15** units.\n\n#### Waiting Times:\n\n* Process A: **0** units\n* Process B: **10** units\n* Process C: **15** units\n\n#### Average Waiting Time:\n\n$$\n\\text{Average Waiting Time} = \\frac{0 + 10 + 15}{3} = \\frac{25}{3} \\approx 8.33 \\text{ units}\n$$\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe **average waiting time** for all three processes is approximately **8.33 units**.\n",

      "feedback": "The answer is excellent and demonstrates a strong understanding of the FCFS scheduling algorithm. The explanation is clear, concise, and easy to follow. The calculations for waiting times of each process and the average waiting time are accurate. The final answer is correctly stated. The answer is well-structured and includes clear headings and explanations for each step.",
