      "content": "Imagine you are building a system to manage a large online library. Each book has a 'popularity score' (an integer representing the number of times it has been borrowed).  You need to display a list of the 100 most popular books on the homepage.  You have millions of books in the library.  Which sorting algorithm would be the most efficient for this task, considering you only need the top 100?",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "What is the time complexity of the algorithm you chose for this specific scenario (finding top 100 out of millions)?",
        "How would your approach change if you needed to periodically update the list (e.g., every hour) with new borrowing data?"
      ],
      "evaluation_points": [
        "Understanding that full sorting is inefficient when only needing the top K elements.",
        "Identifying algorithms suitable for partial sorting like Heap Sort or Quick Select.",

    },
    "answer": "For this task, the most efficient sorting algorithm would be **Quickselect** or using a **Min-Heap**.\n\n1. **Quickselect**: This algorithm can find the top 100 most popular books in **O(n)** time on average, where `n` is the total number of books. It works by partially sorting the array to find the 100th most popular book, and then returning the top 100 books.\n\n2. **Min-Heap**: Build a min-heap of size 100. As you iterate through the millions of books, you maintain the top 100 books in the heap. Insertion and deletion in a heap take **O(log 100)** time, so this approach will run in **O(n log 100)** time, which is more efficient than fully sorting the array.\n\nBoth approaches avoid the need to fully sort the entire list of millions of books, focusing on the top 100 only.\n\n",
    "evaluation": {
      "score": 9,
      "feedback": "The answer is excellent and demonstrates a strong understanding of algorithms suitable for finding the top K elements without fully sorting. Both Quickselect and Min-Heap approaches are correctly identified and their time complexities are accurately stated. The explanation is clear and concise, highlighting the key advantage of avoiding full sorting. The response also correctly identifies the O(log 100) complexity for heap operations, acknowledging that this is a constant factor and therefore still more efficient than O(n log n) algorithms. The choice of appropriate algorithms and their justifications demonstrate good practical application knowledge.",
      "strengths": [
        "Correctly identifies Quickselect and Min-Heap as efficient algorithms.",
        "Accurately describes the time complexity of both algorithms (O(n) for Quickselect and O(n log K) for Min-Heap, where K is 100).",
        "Clearly explains why these approaches are better than full sorting.",
        "Demonstrates a good understanding of the trade-offs between different approaches."
      ],
      "areas_for_improvement": [
        "While accurate, the average case for Quickselect should be emphasized as the worst-case complexity is O(n^2). A brief mention of mitigating worst-case scenarios (e.g., using randomized selection) would strengthen the answer.",
        "Could briefly mention the space complexity implications, e.g., the Min-Heap approach requires O(K) extra space."
      ],
      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Explain how randomized selection can help mitigate the worst-case time complexity of Quickselect.",
        "Compare the space complexities of Quickselect and Min-Heap in this specific scenario (top 100 books)."
