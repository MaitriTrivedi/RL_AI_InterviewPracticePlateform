    "answer": "High Availability (HA) in a software system or service means ensuring that the system is continuously operational and accessible with minimal downtime, even in the event of hardware failures, software bugs, or other issues. It typically involves redundancy, failover mechanisms, and real-time monitoring to quickly recover from failures and maintain service uptime.\n\nThe goal of HA is to achieve near-constant availability, often targeting 99.9% or higher uptime.",
    "evaluation": {
      "score": 9,
      "feedback": "The answer provides a good overview of High Availability. It correctly identifies the core concepts of continuous operation, minimal downtime, and resilience to failures. The mention of redundancy, failover, and real-time monitoring are excellent. Quoting uptime percentages like 99.9% also adds a practical dimension. However, it could be improved by briefly mentioning specific HA techniques or architectures like active-passive, active-active, or load balancing. Also elaborating the types of failures HA protects against (e.g., network failures, datacenter outages, and application errors) could be beneficial.",

        "Accurately defines High Availability and its primary goals.",

        "Can you describe the difference between active-passive and active-active HA architectures?",
        "What are some common strategies for implementing failover in a distributed system?"
