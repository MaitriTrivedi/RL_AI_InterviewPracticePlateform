      "subtopic": "File Systems",
      "difficulty": 1.0000000093594468,
      "content": "What is the primary function of a file system?",

        "Why are file systems important for computer operation?"

    },
    "answer": "The primary function of a file system is to organize, store, retrieve, and manage data on a storage device, such as a hard drive or SSD. It handles the structure of files and directories, ensuring efficient access and data integrity.",
    "evaluation": {
      "score": 8,
      "feedback": "The answer correctly identifies the primary functions of a file system: organizing, storing, retrieving, and managing data on storage devices. It also mentions the handling of file and directory structure, efficient access, and data integrity. However, it could benefit from explicitly mentioning the abstraction layer it provides for accessing data and hiding the complexities of the underlying hardware.",

        "Accurately describes the core functions of a file system.",
        "Highlights the importance of file and directory structure."

      "areas_for_improvement": [
        "Could explicitly mention the abstraction layer provided by the file system.",
        "Could briefly touch on different types of file systems (e.g., FAT32, NTFS, ext4)."
      ],
      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Explain how a file system acts as an abstraction layer between the OS and the storage device.",
        "Describe a scenario where choosing the correct file system type is crucial for performance or compatibility."
