    "answer": "The Application layer (Layer 7) of the OSI model is responsible for displaying the webpage content (like text and images) on your screen.",
    "evaluation": {
      "score": 7,
      "feedback": "The answer correctly identifies the Application Layer as being involved in presenting web content. However, it's slightly oversimplified. While the Application Layer *initiates* the request for the content (e.g., HTTP), the Presentation Layer also plays a crucial, albeit often transparent, role in formatting and encrypting/decrypting data for optimal display. The Application Layer doesn't handle the raw display; instead, the browser application, which operates at the application layer, interprets the data (HTML, CSS, images) and uses the underlying operating system (which interfaces with hardware) to render it to the screen. The Presentation Layer ensures the data is in a suitable format for the application to interpret. While not explicitly incorrect, the answer lacks the nuance expected of a senior engineer or someone with a deeper understanding of network protocols.",

        "Correctly identifies a relevant layer in the OSI model.",

        "Oversimplifies the process of webpage rendering.",
        "Misses the role of the Presentation Layer in data formatting and encryption/decryption for display.",
        "Lacks clarity on the distinction between the Application Layer's request and the browser's rendering process."
      ],
      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Describe the specific functions performed by the Application and Presentation layers in retrieving and displaying a webpage.",
        "Explain how data encryption and decryption fit into the OSI model and their relevance to secure website browsing (HTTPS).",
        "Elaborate on how the browser application interprets data received from the server to display the final webpage to the user, and the role of the OS in the final rendering on the screen."
