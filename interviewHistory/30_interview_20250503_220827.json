    "answer": "Load balancing is the process of distributing incoming traffic (like visitors to your website) across multiple servers to ensure that no single server gets overwhelmed.\n\nWhy it's useful:\nAs your website becomes more popular, more people try to access it at the same time. If all these visitors try to reach a single server, it could get slow or even crash. Load balancing helps by spreading the visitors across several servers, making sure each server only handles a manageable amount of traffic.\n\nSimple analogy:\nImagine you have a busy restaurant (your website), and there's only one waiter (server). If too many people come in, the waiter might not be able to serve them all, and customers would have to wait. Load balancing is like having multiple waiters, each taking care of a group of customers, so everyone gets served quickly and efficiently.\n\nIn short, load balancing helps keep your website fast and reliable, even as traffic increases.",
    "evaluation": {
      "score": 9,
      "feedback": "This is an excellent answer. The explanation of load balancing is clear, concise, and easy to understand. The analogy of the restaurant with multiple waiters is particularly effective. The answer accurately describes how load balancing distributes traffic and improves performance/availability. The reasoning behind using load balancing as traffic increases is well-explained. No significant technical inaccuracies are present.",
      "strengths": [
        "Clear and concise explanation",
        "Effective use of analogy to explain a technical concept",

      "areas_for_improvement": [
        "Could briefly mention different types of load balancing algorithms (e.g., round robin, least connections) for a more comprehensive answer.",
        "Could briefly mention potential drawbacks or complexities of setting up load balancing (e.g., increased infrastructure cost, configuration complexity)."
      ],
      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Describe different load balancing algorithms and their pros/cons.",
        "Explain how session persistence/stickiness is handled in a load-balanced environment."
