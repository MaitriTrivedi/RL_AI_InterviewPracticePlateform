      "content": "Your home router is configured with DHCP and currently assigns IP addresses in the range of 192.168.1.100 to 192.168.1.200. You need to add a network printer that *must* have a static IP address of 192.168.1.15. Explain the steps you would take to configure the printer and your router to ensure the printer always has this IP address and doesn't conflict with any other devices.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "What is the purpose of a DHCP server?",

      "feedback": "The candidate stated they do not know the answer. This indicates a lack of understanding of basic networking concepts such as DHCP, static IP addressing, and IP address conflict resolution. The response demonstrates no knowledge of how to configure a printer with a static IP or how to adjust the DHCP settings on a router.",
