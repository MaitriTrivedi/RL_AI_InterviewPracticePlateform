      "content": "Imagine you're building a simple music player app. The app needs to keep track of the songs in the order they'll be played next. You've decided to use a Linked List data structure to represent this 'play queue'. Describe, in simple terms, how you would add a new song to the *end* of the play queue using a Linked List. What are the basic steps involved?",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "What is the main difference between a Linked List and an Array?",
        "Why might a Linked List be a good choice for a music player's play queue in terms of adding new songs, compared to an Array?"

        "Creating a new Node to hold the song data",

      "feedback": "The candidate stated 'I don't know,' indicating a complete lack of understanding or inability to articulate the process of adding a node to the end of a linked list. This demonstrates a significant gap in knowledge regarding fundamental data structures and algorithms.",
