      "content": "Imagine you're building a website that displays the current weather for a user's city. Explain what caching is and how you might use a simple cache to improve the performance of your website when retrieving this weather data. What potential problem could arise if the weather changes?",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "What is a 'cache hit'?",
        "What is a 'cache miss'?"

      ],
      "expected_time_minutes": 5
    },
    "answer": "**Caching** stores data temporarily to speed up future requests. For a weather website, you can cache the weather data for a city to avoid fetching it from the API every time a user asks for it.\n\n### How to Use Caching:\n\n* When a user requests weather data, check if it's in the cache.\n* If cached, return the data; if not, fetch it from the weather API and store it in the cache.\n\n### Potential Problem:\n\n* **Stale data**: The weather may change, and cached data could become outdated. You can address this by setting cache expiration (e.g., refresh every 10 minutes).\n",

      "feedback": "The answer demonstrates a good understanding of caching and its application in a weather website scenario. It correctly identifies the benefit of caching for performance and the potential problem of stale data. The proposed solution of setting a cache expiration time is also appropriate. However, the answer could be more complete by briefly touching upon different caching strategies (e.g., client-side vs. server-side) or more sophisticated cache invalidation techniques beyond simple expiration.",

        "Practical suggestion of using cache expiration to address the problem."

      "areas_for_improvement": [
        "Lack of discussion regarding different types of caches (e.g., client-side, server-side, distributed)",
        "Oversimplified approach to cache invalidation. The response doesn't address scenarios where the API signals a change needing immediate invalidation."
      ],
      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Explain the differences between client-side and server-side caching and when you might choose one over the other.",
        "Discuss alternative cache invalidation strategies, such as using webhooks or change notifications from the weather API to trigger cache updates."
