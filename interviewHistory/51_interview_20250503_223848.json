      "content": "Imagine you're running a web server, and suddenly the server starts responding very slowly. You suspect a specific process is consuming excessive CPU resources. Describe the steps you would take, using common command-line tools (like `top` or `ps`), to identify the problematic process on a Linux system. What information would you look for to confirm your suspicion?",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "Once you've identified the process, what are some initial steps you might take to mitigate the issue without immediately terminating the process?",
        "What alternative tools or methods could you use to monitor CPU usage in real-time, besides `top` or `ps`?"

      "evaluation_points": [
        "Use of `top` or `ps` to list processes and their CPU usage.",

    "answer": "To identify a process consuming excessive CPU resources on a Linux system:\n\n1. **Use `top`**:\n\n   * Run `top` and look for processes with high **%CPU**.\n   * Note the **PID** of the high-CPU process.\n\n2. **Use `ps`**:\n\n   * Run `ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head -n 10` to list top 10 processes by CPU usage.\n   * Look for processes with high CPU usage.\n\n3. **Use `htop`** (if installed):\n\n   * Run `htop` for a more interactive view of CPU and memory usage.\n   * Identify the processes consuming the most CPU.\n\n4. **Get more details**:\n\n   * Use `ps -p <PID> -o pid,comm,%cpu,%mem` to get detailed info about the specific process.\n   * Investigate logs or check for resource contention.\n\nThis will help pinpoint which process is causing high CPU usage.\n",

      "feedback": "The answer is quite good and covers the basics of identifying a CPU-intensive process using common command-line tools. The use of `top` and `ps` are correctly mentioned, and the explanation is relatively clear. The inclusion of `htop` is a nice bonus, showing awareness of a more user-friendly tool. However, it could benefit from a slightly more thorough discussion of interpreting the results and considering potential causes before concluding that the identified process is definitively the root cause of the slowness. Additionally, suggesting further investigation steps beyond just 'Investigate logs or check for resource contention' would enhance the answer.",
      "strengths": [
        "Correctly identifies `top` and `ps` as tools for identifying CPU usage.",
        "Demonstrates understanding of the `%CPU` column and its importance.",
        "Includes a useful command (`ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head -n 10`) to list top CPU-consuming processes.",
        "Suggests `htop` as a possible alternative."
      ],
      "areas_for_improvement": [
        "Could elaborate on how to interpret the output of `ps -p <PID> -o pid,comm,%cpu,%mem` and what each column signifies.",
        "The \"Investigate logs or check for resource contention\" step is too generic. Provide specific examples, such as checking the application logs for errors or looking for I/O waits."
      ],
      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "How would you determine if the high CPU usage is normal for that particular process, or if it's indicative of a problem?",
        "What are some common causes of high CPU usage in web server processes, and how would you further investigate those causes (e.g., profiling the application code)?",
        "What if `top` and `ps` don't immediately reveal a single process consuming excessive CPU? How would you approach the problem then?"
