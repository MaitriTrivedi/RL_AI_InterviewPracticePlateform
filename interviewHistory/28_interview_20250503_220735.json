      "difficulty": 3.225750000000001,
      "content": "You are building a simple system to represent different types of vehicles.  Implement two classes: `Vehicle` and `Car`. The `Vehicle` class should have attributes `make` (string) and `model` (string). The `Car` class should inherit from `Vehicle` and add an attribute `num_doors` (integer).  Implement a method in both classes called `display_info` which prints out the vehicle information (make, model, and number of doors if it is a car) in a user-friendly format.  For example, a Vehicle might display: \"Make: Toyota, Model: Camry\" and a Car might display: \"Make: Honda, Model: Civic, Number of Doors: 4\".",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "How would you handle a new type of vehicle, say a 'Truck', with an additional attribute 'bed_length'?",
        "What are some advantages of using inheritance in this scenario?"

      "evaluation_points": [
        "Correct class definitions for Vehicle and Car",
        "Proper inheritance from Vehicle to Car",
        "Correct implementation of display_info method in both classes",
        "Accurate handling of the num_doors attribute in the Car class",
        "Understanding of how to represent and display data related to the object"

      "feedback": "The candidate indicated that they did not know the answer. This demonstrates a lack of understanding of basic object-oriented programming concepts such as class definition, inheritance, and method implementation. Given the fundamental nature of the question, the response indicates a significant gap in the candidate's technical skills.",
