      "content": "Imagine you're building a real-time anomaly detection system for network traffic. You're given a continuous stream of network packets, each represented by a tuple `(timestamp, source_ip, destination_ip, packet_size)`. Your task is to detect Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks based on unusual packet size patterns. A DDoS attack is characterized by a large number of packets originating from different source IPs, targeting the same destination IP within a short time window. Specifically, design an algorithm using the sliding window technique to identify potential DDoS attacks, given the following constraints:\n\n1.  **Window Definition:** A sliding window of `T` seconds.\n2.  **DDoS Threshold:** A potential DDoS attack is flagged if, within a single window, the number of distinct source IPs targeting the same destination IP exceeds a threshold `S`, AND the average packet size of packets targeting that destination IP exceeds a threshold `P`.\n3.  **Dynamic Thresholds:** The thresholds `S` and `P` are dynamically adjusted based on historical network behavior.  You have access to a function `get_thresholds(destination_ip, timestamp)` that returns a tuple `(S, P)` representing the dynamically adjusted thresholds *for the current timestamp and destination IP*.\n4.  **Scalability:** The system should be able to handle a large volume of network traffic (millions of packets per second) with minimal latency. Consider efficient data structures and algorithms.\n5. **Memory constraints:** The system can only store data related to the packets within the current window T. No historical packets can be stored.\n\nImplement a function `detect_ddos(packet_stream, T)` that takes a packet stream (an iterable of `(timestamp, source_ip, destination_ip, packet_size)` tuples) and the window size `T` in seconds, and returns a list of `(timestamp, destination_ip)` tuples, indicating the timestamp and destination IP of detected potential DDoS attacks.",

      "feedback": "The candidate stated \"don't know,\" indicating a complete lack of response to the question. Therefore, the answer demonstrates no understanding of the problem, no proposed solution, and no attempt to address any of the requirements or constraints. The answer fails to address the sliding window technique, dynamic threshold adjustments, data structure considerations for scalability, or memory constraints. There's no discussion of potential challenges like out-of-order packets or how to handle high-volume data streams.",
