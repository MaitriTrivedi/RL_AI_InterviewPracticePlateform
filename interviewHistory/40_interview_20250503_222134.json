      "subtopic": "Normalization",
      "difficulty": 1.0,
      "content": "Imagine you have a table storing customer information, including their name, address, and the product they purchased. If you repeatedly store the full address for each purchase a customer makes, what problem might this cause, and how does normalization help prevent this?",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "Can you give a simple example of a piece of data that would only need to be stored once thanks to normalization?",
        "What is the goal of normalization in general?"

      "evaluation_points": [
        "Data redundancy/duplication",
        "Increased storage space",
        "Potential for inconsistencies if an address needs to be updated (update anomaly)",
        "Normalization reduces redundancy and improves data integrity."

      "score": 0,
      "feedback": "The answer \"don't know\" indicates a complete lack of understanding of the concept of data redundancy, update anomalies, and database normalization. The response fails to address any aspect of the question regarding the problem of repeated address storage or how normalization helps.",

        "Ability to apply database concepts to a practical scenario."

      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Study the concept of data redundancy and its drawbacks (e.g., increased storage, inconsistencies).",
        "Research update anomalies and other data integrity issues that can arise from unnormalized databases.",
        "Learn about the different normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, etc.) and how to achieve them.",
        "Practice applying normalization techniques to real-world examples of database design."
