      "content": "Imagine you're building a simple 'Car' class. Explain how encapsulation would help you protect the 'speed' attribute of the car from being directly and inappropriately modified from outside the class. Provide a basic code snippet (in any language you are comfortable with) to illustrate this concept.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "Why is directly modifying the 'speed' attribute potentially problematic?",
        "Besides 'speed', can you think of another attribute of a 'Car' class where encapsulation would be beneficial?"

        "Definition of encapsulation: bundling data and methods that operate on that data, restricting direct access to some of the object's components.",
        "Use of private/protected access modifiers to control access to 'speed' attribute.",
        "Use of getter/setter methods (or properties) to access and modify the 'speed' attribute in a controlled manner.",

Speed must be between 0 and 200.\")\n\n# Usage\ncar = Car()\ncar.set_speed(50)  # Valid speed\nprint(car.get_speed())  # Output: 50\ncar.set_speed(300)  # Invalid speed, won't be set\n",

      "score": 9,
      "feedback": "The answer is very good and demonstrates a strong understanding of encapsulation. The code snippet clearly illustrates how to protect the 'speed' attribute using getter and setter methods, including validation to ensure data integrity. The explanation implicitly covers the definition of encapsulation by showing how the 'speed' attribute is controlled within the class. The use of `_speed` to indicate a 'private' attribute is standard Python practice, although it doesn't truly enforce privacy. Overall, a well-structured and practical answer.",
      "strengths": [
        "Correct implementation of getter and setter methods.",
        "Includes data validation within the setter method to protect data integrity.",
        "Clear and concise code example.",
        "Demonstrates a practical understanding of how to use encapsulation."

      "areas_for_improvement": [
        "Could explicitly mention that Python doesn't have true private variables, and the underscore convention is a signal to other developers.",
        "Could explicitly define what Encapsulation is in the response."
      ],
      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Explain the difference between public, private, and protected access modifiers in languages that support them (e.g., Java, C++). Discuss how Python's approach to privacy differs.",
        "Discuss potential performance implications of using getter/setter methods versus direct attribute access, and when it's appropriate to use each approach."
