      "topic": null,
      "subtopic": "CPU Scheduling",
      "difficulty": 10.0,
      "content": "Consider a real-time embedded system controlling a robotic arm used in a high-precision assembly line. This system employs a hybrid CPU scheduling approach, combining Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS) for periodic tasks (e.g., motor control, sensor data acquisition) and Earliest Deadline First (EDF) for aperiodic tasks (e.g., emergency stop triggered by a safety sensor, dynamically adjusting torque based on material characteristics detected mid-process). Assume the system is running at a utilization level close to its theoretical limit.\n\nDescribe a scenario where priority inversion could occur, even with RMS and EDF operating correctly individually. Explain in detail how a Priority Ceiling Protocol (PCP) could be implemented to mitigate this specific inversion problem in this hybrid RMS/EDF environment. Elaborate on any challenges in integrating PCP within this hybrid scheduling scheme, particularly considering the potential for deadline misses caused by PCP's priority inheritance during EDF tasks, and propose solutions to address these challenges. Consider scenarios involving tasks with shared resources (e.g., access to a shared communication bus or a lookup table in shared memory). Assume EDF tasks can preempt RMS tasks, and RMS tasks preempt lower priority RMS tasks.",

      "feedback": "The response \"don't know\" indicates a complete lack of understanding of the concepts involved. It doesn't demonstrate any knowledge of priority inversion, Rate Monotonic Scheduling, Earliest Deadline First scheduling, Priority Ceiling Protocol, or the challenges associated with real-time scheduling and resource management. The question required understanding of how a hybrid scheduling system with RMS and EDF might experience priority inversion, even if RMS and EDF were individually operating correctly. It also asked about how PCP could be applied in this hybrid environment, accounting for the potential impact of priority inheritance on EDF task deadlines. The response provides no indication of understanding or ability to address these points.",
