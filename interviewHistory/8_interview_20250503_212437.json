      "topic": null,
      "subtopic": "Memory Management",
      "difficulty": 1.0,
      "content": "In the context of memory management, what is a memory leak, and can you provide a simple scenario where one might occur in a program?",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "What are some potential consequences of a memory leak in a long-running application?",
        "Can you name one tool or technique that can help detect memory leaks?"
      ],
      "evaluation_points": [
        "Memory leak definition (unreleased allocated memory)",
        "Simple scenario (e.g., allocating memory but not freeing it, losing a pointer to allocated memory)",
        "Understanding that memory leaks lead to resource exhaustion"

    "evaluation": {
      "score": 0,
      "feedback": "The answer 'dont know' indicates a complete lack of understanding of the memory leak concept. The candidate provided no information about what a memory leak is, how it occurs, or its consequences. The response demonstrates no knowledge related to memory management.",

      "areas_for_improvement": [
        "Understanding of memory management concepts",
        "Ability to define and explain memory leaks",

      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Review the concepts of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation in the programming language of your choice (e.g., C, C++, Java, Python).",
        "Study examples of memory leaks and how to prevent them using tools like valgrind (for C/C++) or memory profilers."
