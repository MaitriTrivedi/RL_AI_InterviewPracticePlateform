      "subtopic": "Memory Management",
      "difficulty": 4.0,
      "content": "Imagine you're developing a simple image processing application that loads and manipulates images. You notice that after processing several large images in a row, the application becomes sluggish and eventually crashes with an 'Out of Memory' error.  What is a potential cause of this issue related to memory management, and how would you go about identifying and addressing it in your code?",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "What tools or techniques could you use to monitor memory usage in your application?",
        "How would you change your code if you identified a memory leak as the cause?"
      ],
      "evaluation_points": [
        "Memory leak due to unreleased memory after image processing.",
        "Importance of explicit memory deallocation (e.g., using `delete` in C++, `free` in C, or ensuring proper garbage collection in managed languages)",
        "Using profiling tools to identify memory allocation patterns.",
        "Proper resource management (e.g., using RAII or try-finally blocks)."
      ],
      "expected_time_minutes": 10
    },
    "answer": "The potential cause is a memory leak \u2014 the application might not be properly releasing memory after processing each image, causing it to accumulate over time and eventually exhaust available memory.\n\nTo address this:\n\nIdentify the issue: Use memory profiling tools (e.g., Valgrind, Visual Studio Profiler) to track memory allocation and identify leaks.\n\nFix it: Ensure that memory allocated for images is properly deallocated after each image is processed. Use techniques like manual memory management (in languages like C++) or rely on garbage collection (in languages like Java or Python) to handle cleanup.\n\nOptimize memory usage: Consider processing smaller image chunks or using more memory-efficient algorithms.",
    "evaluation": {
      "score": 7,
      "feedback": "The answer correctly identifies memory leaks as a potential cause and suggests using profiling tools. It also mentions the importance of proper memory deallocation and optimization techniques. However, it lacks specific examples and depth regarding different memory management approaches in different languages and how to implement robust resource management. It also doesn't explicitly mention using RAII or try-finally blocks, which are crucial for exception safety when dealing with memory management.",
      "strengths": [
        "Correctly identifies memory leaks as a primary cause.",
        "Recommends using memory profiling tools for identification.",
        "Suggests memory deallocation and optimization as solutions."
      ],
      "areas_for_improvement": [
        "Lacks specific examples of memory deallocation techniques (e.g., 'delete' in C++, garbage collection nuances in Java/Python).",
        "Doesn't emphasize exception safety and RAII/try-finally for resource management.",
        "Could elaborate on different memory-efficient algorithms for image processing."
      ],
      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Explain how `delete` in C++ works and why it's important to match every `new` with a `delete`. Also, discuss smart pointers as a better alternative.",
        "Discuss how garbage collection works in Java/Python and when it might not be enough (e.g., object references held longer than needed).",
        "Describe RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) and how it can be used to ensure resources are released even in the presence of exceptions. Explain how try-finally blocks can achieve similar results in some languages."
