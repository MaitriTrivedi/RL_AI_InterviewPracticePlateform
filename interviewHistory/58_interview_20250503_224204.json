      "difficulty": 5.0,
      "content": "You are designing a system for a library to manage different types of media: Books, DVDs, and Audiobooks. Each media type has common attributes like a title, author/creator, publication year, and unique ID. They also have specific attributes: Books have an ISBN, DVDs have a duration (in minutes), and Audiobooks have a narrator. Implement a class hierarchy in Python using inheritance to model these media types. Include a method in each class to display all the media's information in a formatted string. Avoid code duplication as much as possible. Also, implement a function that can take a list of media objects (of any type within your hierarchy) and print their information to the console.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "How would you modify your design if a new media type, such as 'E-book,' needed to be added, sharing some characteristics with Books but also having its own unique attributes (e.g., file size)?",
        "Explain how polymorphism is demonstrated in your solution when the `display_info()` method is called on different media objects.",
        "What are the potential drawbacks of using inheritance in this scenario, and could composition be a better alternative? Why or why not?"
      ],
      "evaluation_points": [
        "Correct use of inheritance to create a base class (Media) and derived classes (Book, DVD, Audiobook).",
        "Effective sharing of common attributes in the base class to avoid code duplication.",
        "Proper implementation of the display_info() method in each class to handle specific attributes.",
        "Successful use of polymorphism to call display_info() on different object types.",
        "The candidate avoids unnecessary complexity and produces clean, readable code."

      "feedback": "The candidate stated \"I don't know\", indicating a complete lack of understanding or inability to solve the problem. This response demonstrates no knowledge of object-oriented programming, inheritance, polymorphism, or class design in Python. There is no code or explanation to evaluate. All key aspects of the question, including inheritance, polymorphism, and object-oriented principles, were missed.",

        "Study basic object-oriented programming concepts (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism).",
        "Work through introductory Python tutorials covering class definitions and inheritance.",
        "Practice implementing similar class hierarchies to solidify understanding."
