      "follow_up_questions": [
        "Can you give a basic example of how a load balancer might decide where to send a user's request?",

    "answer": "A **load balancer** is like a traffic director for your website. When many people visit your site, the load balancer **distributes** their requests evenly across multiple servers, so no single server gets overwhelmed.\n\n### Why it's helpful:\n\n* **Even distribution**: Without a load balancer, one server might get too many requests and crash, slowing down or even causing the site to go offline. The load balancer ensures each server gets a fair share of the requests, preventing any one server from being overloaded.\n* **Scalability**: As your website grows and gets even more visitors, the load balancer can direct traffic to **additional servers** you add, ensuring the site remains fast and stable.\n* **Reliability**: If one server fails, the load balancer can redirect traffic to healthy servers, keeping the site running smoothly.\n\nIn short, a load balancer helps keep your website fast and available even when traffic spikes, by making sure that the workload is spread out across multiple servers.\n",
    "evaluation": {
      "score": 9,
      "feedback": "This is a very strong answer that accurately and clearly explains the role of a load balancer. The analogy of a 'traffic director' is excellent and easy to understand. The explanation of 'even distribution,' 'scalability,' and 'reliability' effectively covers the benefits of using a load balancer. The answer demonstrates a good understanding of how load balancers contribute to website performance and availability under heavy traffic. The inclusion of how adding more servers impacts the system is great. The answer provides practical application and demonstrates the candidate's understanding of real-world scenarios.",
      "strengths": [
        "Clear and concise explanation of load balancing concepts.",
        "Effective use of analogy to simplify complex topics.",
        "Comprehensive coverage of the benefits of load balancing (distribution, scalability, reliability).",
        "Demonstrates practical understanding of website traffic management."
      ],
      "areas_for_improvement": [
        "Could briefly mention different load balancing algorithms (e.g., round robin, least connections) for extra depth, though this wasn't explicitly asked for.",
        "While not necessary, you *could* subtly allude to the fact that Load Balancers themselves can be made redundant."
      ],
      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Explain the different types of load balancing algorithms and their use cases.",
        "Describe different types of load balancers (hardware vs. software) and their pros/cons.",
        "Discuss how health checks are used by load balancers to determine server availability."
