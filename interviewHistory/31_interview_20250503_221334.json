      "content": "Your computer can communicate with a web server across the internet. Describe the role of the Transport layer (Layer 4) in ensuring reliable data transfer between your computer and the server. Specifically, what happens if some packets are lost or arrive out of order?",

    "answer": "Transport Layer (Layer 4) Role:\nReliable data transfer: Ensures error handling, retransmission of lost packets, and correct sequencing.\n\nPacket sequencing: Reassembles packets in the correct order.\n\nFlow and congestion control: Prevents network overload and adjusts data flow.\n\nCommon Protocols:\nTCP: Reliable, ordered, error-checked delivery.\n\nUDP: Faster, but without guarantees.\n\nNetwork Efficiency:\nEnsures correct data delivery, prevents congestion, and optimizes flow control.",

      "score": 7,
      "feedback": "The answer provides a decent overview of the transport layer's role in reliable data transfer. It correctly identifies error handling, retransmission, and packet sequencing as key responsibilities. Mentioning flow and congestion control is also accurate. The inclusion of TCP and UDP protocols adds value. However, the answer lacks depth regarding *how* these mechanisms are implemented and the specifics of how the transport layer handles packet loss or out-of-order arrival. The \"Network Efficiency\" section is vague and doesn't add much substance. The response could benefit from elaborating on acknowledgment mechanisms and the use of sequence numbers.",
      "strengths": [
        "Identifies key responsibilities of the Transport Layer: reliable transfer, sequencing, flow/congestion control.",
        "Mentions TCP and UDP as common protocols and their characteristics.",
        "Highlights the role in preventing network overload."
      ],
      "areas_for_improvement": [
        "Lacks specifics on how retransmission, sequencing, and error handling are implemented (e.g., using sequence numbers, acknowledgments, checksums).",
        "The explanation of how the Transport Layer handles packet loss and out-of-order delivery is too superficial. Needs details on how acknowledgements and sequence numbers are used to detect and correct these problems.",
        "The \"Network Efficiency\" section is too general and doesn't provide any concrete information."
      ],
      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Describe the TCP handshake process and how it establishes a reliable connection.",
        "Explain the role of sequence numbers and acknowledgment numbers in TCP.",
        "Elaborate on how TCP handles congestion control, specifically mentioning algorithms like TCP Congestion Avoidance (e.g., slow start, congestion avoidance, fast retransmit/fast recovery)."
