    "answer": "**CPU scheduling** is the process by which an operating system decides which process (or task) gets to use the CPU (Central Processing Unit) and for how long. The goal is to efficiently allocate CPU time to different processes so that the system operates smoothly and meets performance requirements.\n\n### Importance of CPU Scheduling:\n\n1. **Maximizing CPU Utilization**: By effectively scheduling tasks, the CPU can remain as busy as possible, minimizing idle time and maximizing throughput.\n\n2. **Fairness**: CPU scheduling ensures that each process gets a fair share of CPU time. This prevents any single process from monopolizing the CPU, especially in a multitasking environment.\n\n3. **Meeting Process Priorities**: Some processes may require more urgent attention or have higher priority (e.g., real-time processes). Scheduling helps ensure these processes get CPU time when needed.\n\n4. **Improving System Performance**: By optimizing CPU scheduling, the system can be made faster, more responsive, and capable of handling multiple tasks simultaneously without significant delays.\n\n### Key Concepts in CPU Scheduling:\n\n* **Process Queue**: Processes are typically placed in a queue (ready queue) waiting for CPU time.\n* **Scheduling Algorithms**: There are various algorithms for CPU scheduling, like:\n\n  * **FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)**\n  * **Round Robin**\n  * **SJF (Shortest Job First)**\n  * **Priority Scheduling**\n  * **Multilevel Queue Scheduling**\n\nIn summary, CPU scheduling is crucial because it manages how the CPU handles multiple processes, ensuring efficient execution, fairness, and system responsiveness.\n",

      "feedback": "This is a solid answer that demonstrates a good understanding of CPU scheduling. The definition is accurate, and the explanation of its importance is well-structured and covers key aspects like CPU utilization, fairness, and priority. Mentioning different scheduling algorithms and the process queue adds further depth. However, the answer could benefit from elaborating on the trade-offs between different scheduling algorithms and providing concrete examples where each algorithm would be most suitable.",
