      "topic": null,
      "subtopic": "Scalability",
      "difficulty": 1.0,
      "content": "Imagine you're building a website that initially serves only a small number of users. What does it mean for your website to be \"scalable,\" and why is scalability important even when starting small?",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "Can you give a simple example of a way to improve the scalability of a basic website?",
        "What's the opposite of a scalable system, and what are some drawbacks of that type of system?"
      ],
      "evaluation_points": [
        "Ability to handle increased load or growth",
        "Importance for future growth and avoiding performance bottlenecks",
        "Efficiency and cost-effectiveness in handling more users"
      ],
      "expected_time_minutes": 5
    },
    "answer": "Scalability means designing your website to handle increased traffic and user growth without sacrificing performance. Even if you start small, scalability is important because it allows your site to adapt to unexpected traffic spikes, maintain fast load times, and avoid costly overhauls in the future as your user base grows. It ensures a good user experience and helps keep costs efficient as demand increases.",
    "evaluation": {
      "score": 8,
      "feedback": "The answer provides a good high-level understanding of scalability and its importance, even when starting small. It correctly identifies that scalability is about handling increased traffic/users without performance degradation, and highlights the benefits of avoiding costly overhauls and maintaining a good user experience. However, it lacks specific examples of techniques or strategies to achieve scalability. It also doesn't touch upon different types of scalability (vertical vs. horizontal) or mention considerations like database scalability or CDN usage. More details regarding practical implementation would elevate the answer.",
      "strengths": [
        "Clearly defines scalability in the context of a website.",
        "Accurately explains the importance of scalability from the beginning, even with a small user base.",
        "Highlights the benefits of scalability such as avoiding costly overhauls and maintaining user experience.",
        "Mentions cost efficiency as a result of scalability."
      ],
      "areas_for_improvement": [
        "Lacks concrete examples of scalability techniques (e.g., load balancing, caching, database sharding).",
        "Doesn't differentiate between vertical and horizontal scalability.",
        "Misses mentioning aspects related to database scalability and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs).",
        "Could be improved by mentioning the importance of modular architecture and microservices for future scaling efforts."
      ],
      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Explain the difference between vertical and horizontal scaling, and provide examples of when each approach would be suitable.",
        "Describe at least three specific techniques for improving website scalability (e.g., load balancing, caching, database optimization).",
        "Discuss the role of CDNs in improving website scalability and performance."
