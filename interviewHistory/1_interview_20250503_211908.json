      "content": "You are given an array of integers representing the daily stock prices. Your task is to find the maximum profit you can achieve by buying and selling the stock only once. You must buy before you sell. For example, given the array `[7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]`, the maximum profit is `5` (buying at 1 and selling at 6). Explain your approach and provide the code to find the maximum profit from the given array. The solution should efficiently iterate the array only once.",

    "evaluation": {
      "score": 9,
      "feedback": "The solution is correct, efficient, and well-explained. The code correctly finds the maximum profit by iterating through the array only once, keeping track of the minimum buying price, and calculating the profit at each step. The use of `float('inf')` for initializing `min_price` is appropriate. The code handles the case where no profit can be made gracefully (returning 0). The explanation is clear and easy to follow. Excellent job! Only a slight improvement could be added by including a short docstring to the function.",
