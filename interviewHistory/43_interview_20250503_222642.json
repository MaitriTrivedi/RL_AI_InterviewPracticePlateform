      "content": "Imagine you have a website that is suddenly getting a lot more traffic than usual. You want to ensure all users have a good experience and your servers don't crash. How would a load balancer help in this scenario?",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "Can you briefly describe one simple algorithm a load balancer might use to decide which server to send traffic to?",
        "What's a basic benefit of using a load balancer even if you don't have a huge amount of traffic?"
      ],
      "evaluation_points": [
        "Distributes traffic across multiple servers",

    },
    "answer": "A **load balancer** helps by **distributing incoming traffic** across multiple servers, ensuring no single server gets overwhelmed with too many requests.\n\n### How it helps:\n\n1. **Even traffic distribution**: The load balancer takes the incoming requests and directs them to the available servers in a balanced way. This ensures that no server becomes a bottleneck, improving performance and preventing crashes.\n\n2. **Scalability**: As traffic grows, you can add more servers behind the load balancer, allowing your system to handle more users without a degradation in performance.\n\n3. **Fault tolerance**: If one server fails, the load balancer can redirect traffic to the remaining healthy servers, preventing downtime and maintaining the user experience.\n\nIn short, the load balancer acts as a traffic manager, efficiently allocating user requests across multiple servers, keeping the system responsive and stable even under heavy traffic.\n",
    "evaluation": {
      "score": 9,
      "feedback": "This is a very good answer that clearly explains how a load balancer helps in handling increased website traffic. The explanation covers the core benefits: even traffic distribution, scalability, and fault tolerance. The description is easy to understand and highlights the practical advantages of using a load balancer. The summary effectively reinforces the main points. The answer shows a solid understanding of load balancing concepts.",

        "Could briefly mention different load balancing algorithms (e.g., round robin, least connections) to showcase deeper understanding, but not essential for a general overview.",
        "Could mention the different types of load balancers (e.g., hardware, software, cloud-based) for a more comprehensive understanding, though not essential for this question."

      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Describe different load balancing algorithms (e.g., round robin, least connections) and their use cases.",
        "Discuss the trade-offs between different types of load balancers (hardware, software, cloud-based)."
