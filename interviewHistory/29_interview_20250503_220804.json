      "feedback": "The candidate stated they did not know the answer. Therefore, the response demonstrates no understanding of garbage collection concepts, its purpose, or its role in memory management. The answer completely misses the mark regarding automatic memory management, reclaiming unused memory, and preventing memory leaks.",
