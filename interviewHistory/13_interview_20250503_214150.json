      "difficulty": 1.0,
      "content": "Imagine you have a simple lock with 3 dials, each numbered 0-9. You want to find all possible combinations to try to unlock it, but you don't want to repeat any combinations you've already tried. Explain how you could use the concept of backtracking to systematically explore all possible combinations without repetition.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "Can you describe the base case for your backtracking approach in this lock example?",
        "How would you modify your approach if you knew that certain dial values could never be correct (e.g., the first dial can't be '0')?"

    },
    "answer": "To use backtracking for exploring all possible lock combinations without repetition:\n\nStart with the first dial: Try all values (0-9).\n\nMove to the second dial: For each value of the first dial, try all values (0-9) for the second dial.\n\nMove to the third dial: For each combination of the first two dials, try all values (0-9) for the third dial.\n\nAvoid repetition: Track tried combinations using a set or list, and check each new combination against it before trying it.\n\nBacktracking ensures you explore each combination systematically without revisiting any.",
    "evaluation": {
      "score": 7,
      "feedback": "The answer describes a valid approach to solving the problem, but it doesn't explicitly highlight the recursive nature of backtracking. It correctly identifies the need to explore each dial value and the importance of tracking tried combinations to avoid repetition. However, the explanation could be clearer in illustrating the \"backtracking\" aspect \u2013 how the algorithm returns to previous decision points to explore other branches of the solution space. The use of recursion, which is fundamental to backtracking, is only implicitly suggested rather than explicitly stated. Also the answer doesn't discuss the base case of the recursion.",

        "Identifies the core task of exploring all dial values.",

        "Explicitly explain the recursive process involved in backtracking.",
        "Describe the base case for the recursion.",
        "Provide a more detailed explanation of how the algorithm 'backtracks' when a path is exhausted."
      ],
      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Explain how the algorithm would revert to a previous dial if a complete combination has been tried and needs to explore further.",
        "Walk through a small example with specific dial values (e.g., dials 1, 2, and 3) to illustrate the backtracking process step-by-step.",
        "Describe the base case of the recursion - when is the recursion stopped?"
