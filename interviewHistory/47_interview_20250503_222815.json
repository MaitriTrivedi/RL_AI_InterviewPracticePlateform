      "topic": null,
      "subtopic": "TCP/UDP",
      "difficulty": 1.0,
      "content": "In a simple client-server application, you need to send a small, single message from the client to the server and don't need confirmation of receipt. Which transport protocol, TCP or UDP, would be more appropriate and why?",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "What is the main difference between TCP and UDP in terms of reliability?",
        "Can you give a simple example of an application that commonly uses UDP?"
      ],
      "evaluation_points": [
        "UDP is more appropriate.",
        "UDP is connectionless and lightweight, suitable for small, non-critical messages where speed is prioritized over guaranteed delivery.",
        "TCP guarantees delivery and order of packets, but adds overhead."

      "feedback": "The answer 'I don't know' demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of fundamental networking concepts. The question assesses knowledge of TCP and UDP protocols and their appropriate use cases. The answer provides no technical insight or reasoning.",

        "Understanding of TCP and UDP protocols",
        "Knowledge of the differences between connection-oriented and connectionless protocols",

      ],
      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Study the basics of the TCP/IP model and the transport layer protocols TCP and UDP.",
        "Research the use cases where TCP is preferred over UDP and vice versa. Pay attention to scenarios involving reliability, speed, and message size.",
        "Practice applying your knowledge by considering different network applications and determining the most suitable transport protocol for each."
