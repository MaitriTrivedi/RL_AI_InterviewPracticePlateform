      "content": "You are designing a large-scale social network analysis system to detect and analyze coordinated inauthentic behavior (CIB) - malicious campaigns involving many accounts acting in a synchronized manner to spread disinformation or propaganda. The social network is represented as a directed graph G(V, E), where V represents user accounts and E represents follower/followee relationships. Given a snapshot of the network and a set of K accounts suspected of being involved in CIB, devise an algorithm to identify other potentially compromised accounts that are highly likely to be participating in the same CIB campaign. Your algorithm should consider the following factors:\n\n1.  **Temporal Influence:** CIB accounts often amplify each other's messages within a short time window.  For each edge (u, v) in the graph, you have a timestamp t(u, v) indicating when user u followed user v (or interacted with their content). Assume you are given a temporal influence window \u0394t. The impact of user 'u' on user 'v' is deemed relevant only if the interaction occurred within \u0394t of other relevant interactions in the network.\n2.  **Community Structure:** CIB accounts often form dense communities, promoting and amplifying each other's messages. You can use community detection algorithms to identify these communities, but these algorithms are computationally expensive and may not be perfectly accurate.\n3.  **Message Similarity:**  Accounts participating in CIB often share or generate similar messages. You can quantify the similarity between the messages posted by two accounts using a similarity metric (e.g., cosine similarity on TF-IDF vectors). You have access to a function `similarity(account1, account2)` that returns the similarity score between two accounts' recent posts.\n4.  **Scalability:** The social network is massive (millions or billions of accounts and edges). Your algorithm must be efficient and scalable. Provide time and space complexity analysis. The algorithm should also consider potential graph updates (new users, new connections). Explain how your algorithm will handle graph dynamics efficiently.\n\nSpecifically, propose an algorithm to calculate a 'CIB susceptibility score' for each account in the network, indicating the likelihood of that account being involved in the CIB campaign.  The algorithm must incorporate all four factors mentioned above. Your answer should include a detailed description of the algorithm, the rationale behind your design choices, and a discussion of its limitations.",
