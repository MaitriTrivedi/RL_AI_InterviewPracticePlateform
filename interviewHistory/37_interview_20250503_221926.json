    "answer": "A cache is a small, high-speed storage area that temporarily stores frequently accessed data or instructions to speed up access to that data.\n\nPrimary Purpose:\nThe main purpose of a cache is to reduce access time to data that is used repeatedly, improving overall system performance. By storing copies of frequently used data closer to the processor or application, the system can avoid slower data retrieval operations (like accessing a hard drive or a remote server).\n\nIn short, caches help make systems faster by providing quicker access to commonly used information.",

      "score": 8,
      "feedback": "The answer provides a good overview of what a cache is and its primary purpose. It correctly identifies the cache as a small, high-speed storage area for frequently accessed data and highlights its role in improving system performance by reducing access time. The explanation is clear and easy to understand. However, it could be improved by mentioning different types of caches (e.g., CPU cache, browser cache, disk cache) and their specific roles in different parts of a system. Also, mentioning cache replacement policies would improve the answer. While it touches upon avoiding slower data retrieval, elaborating with examples (e.g., reducing network latency or disk I/O) would provide more context.",
