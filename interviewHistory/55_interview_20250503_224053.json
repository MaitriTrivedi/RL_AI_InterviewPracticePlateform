      "topic": null,
      "subtopic": "OSI Model",
      "difficulty": 2.25,
      "content": "When you visit a website using a web browser, data travels through different layers of the OSI model. At which layer does the web browser mainly interact to send your request (e.g., to load a webpage)? Which layer is responsible for the physical transmission of data as electrical signals or radio waves?",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "Can you name another protocol that operates at the application layer, other than HTTP?",
        "Which layer ensures reliable data transfer between two applications and what is one common protocol used at this layer?"
      ],
      "evaluation_points": [
        "Application layer (for browser interaction)",
        "Physical layer (for transmission)",
        "Understanding of the two layers function is important."
      ],
      "expected_time_minutes": 3
    },
    "answer": "When you visit a website, the web browser mainly interacts with the **Application Layer (Layer 7)** to send your request (e.g., to load a webpage).\n\nThe **Physical Layer (Layer 1)** is responsible for the physical transmission of data as electrical signals, light pulses, or radio waves, depending on the communication medium.\n",
    "evaluation": {
      "score": 10,
      "feedback": "The answer is perfectly accurate and complete. It correctly identifies the Application Layer as the primary interaction point for the browser and the Physical Layer as responsible for the physical transmission of data. The explanation is clear and concise.",
      "strengths": [
        "Accurate identification of the Application Layer's role.",
        "Correctly identifies the Physical Layer's function.",
        "Clear and concise explanation."

      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Could be asked about protocols used at the application layer, like HTTP or HTTPS.",
        "Could be asked about different physical layer technologies, like Ethernet or Wi-Fi."
