    },
    "answer": "The primary goal of congestion control in network communication is to prevent network congestion by regulating the amount of data being sent into the network. This ensures that the network can handle the traffic load without becoming overwhelmed, which could result in packet loss, delays, or even a complete network shutdown.",
    "evaluation": {
      "score": 7,
      "feedback": "The answer correctly identifies the primary goal of congestion control as preventing network congestion. It accurately links congestion to negative consequences like packet loss and delays. However, it primarily focuses on overload prevention and could be strengthened by explicitly mentioning throughput maintenance and packet loss minimization as key, interwoven goals. While prevention is essential, congestion control also strives to *maximize* throughput *while* keeping packet loss at an acceptable level. The answer also lacks any practical examples or real-world scenarios where congestion control is vital.",

        "Correctly identifies the main purpose of congestion control: preventing network congestion.",

        "Could explicitly state that the goal is not just preventing overload, but also maximizing throughput and minimizing packet loss *simultaneously*.",
        "Lacks practical examples or real-world application contexts."

      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Explain how different congestion control mechanisms (e.g., TCP's congestion control algorithms) achieve the balance between throughput and loss.",
        "Describe a scenario (e.g., video streaming) where effective congestion control is crucial for a good user experience."
