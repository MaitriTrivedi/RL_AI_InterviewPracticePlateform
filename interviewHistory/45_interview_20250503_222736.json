      "difficulty": 1.5,
      "content": "Imagine you are creating a program to store the scores of students in a class. Explain how you could use an array to store these scores. What are the advantages of using an array for this purpose?",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "What is the index of the first element in the array?",
        "If the class has 20 students, how big would the array need to be?"
      ],
      "evaluation_points": [
        "Definition of an array as a contiguous block of memory for storing elements of the same type.",
        "Understanding of how elements are accessed using an index (starting from 0).",
        "Advantages include efficient access to elements by index and simple implementation for storing fixed-size collections of data.",
        "Mention that arrays have a fixed size defined upon creation."
