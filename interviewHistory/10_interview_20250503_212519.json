      "content": "In the context of the CAP Theorem, briefly define Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance. Can you give a simple example of a system that prioritizes Availability over Consistency?",

        "If a system chooses to sacrifice Availability, what does that typically mean for the user?",
        "Which of the three properties (Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance) is generally considered the least negotiable in a distributed system, and why?"

    },
    "answer": "The CAP Theorem (Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance) states that a distributed system can only guarantee two out of the three properties at the same time.\n\nDefinitions:\nConsistency: Every read operation returns the most recent write, ensuring all nodes have the same data at any given time.\n\nAvailability: Every request (read or write) receives a response, even if some nodes are unavailable. The system is always operational.\n\nPartition Tolerance: The system continues to function even when network partitions occur, meaning some nodes can't communicate with others.\n\nExample of a System Prioritizing Availability over Consistency:\nExample: DNS (Domain Name System)\nDNS prioritizes Availability over Consistency. If a user tries to look up a website, DNS might return an outdated IP address because one of the DNS servers might be out of sync with others. However, DNS still responds to the request, ensuring availability of the service, even if the data isn't perfectly consistent across all servers.\n\nThis is an example of an AP (Availability and Partition Tolerance) system in the context of the CAP theorem.",
    "evaluation": {
      "score": 9,
      "feedback": "The answer demonstrates a strong understanding of the CAP Theorem and its components. The definitions of Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance are accurate and clearly stated. The DNS example is relevant and appropriately explains why Availability is prioritized over Consistency in that system. The response also correctly identifies DNS as an AP system. The answer could be slightly improved by explicitly stating why Partition Tolerance is almost always non-negotiable in distributed systems and perhaps give a slightly more compelling example than DNS which, while correct, might not be immediately obvious to all interviewers in demonstrating the trade-off.",

        "Accurate definitions of Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.",

        "Could explicitly state why Partition Tolerance is generally non-negotiable.",
        "The example (DNS) is valid, but a social media feed example might be more relatable to the interviewer and demonstrate the trade-off more intuitively."

      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Explain why Partition Tolerance is almost always a requirement in distributed systems and how it affects the choice between Consistency and Availability.",
        "Consider alternative examples (e.g., social media feeds, eventually consistent databases) to illustrate the concept of prioritizing Availability over Consistency. Think about situations where eventual consistency is 'good enough'.",
        "Consider discussing the nuances of different Consistency models (e.g., eventual consistency, strong consistency)."
