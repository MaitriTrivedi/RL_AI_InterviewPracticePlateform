      "content": "What is a memory leak, and can you give a simple example of how one might occur in a program (you don't need to write actual code)?",

    },
    "answer": "A memory leak occurs when a program allocates memory but fails to release it after it's no longer needed, causing the program to use more and more memory over time, eventually leading to performance issues or crashes.\n\nSimple example:\nA program dynamically allocates memory for an object but forgets to free it when done. Each time this happens, the memory is no longer available for reuse, causing the program's memory usage to grow unnecessarily.",
    "evaluation": {
      "score": 8,
      "feedback": "The answer correctly identifies the core concept of a memory leak as the failure to release allocated memory that is no longer in use. It also accurately describes the consequence of memory leaks: increased memory usage leading to performance problems or crashes. The example provided is simple and understandable. However, the answer could benefit from explicitly stating the inaccessibility of the leaked memory as a key characteristic. Furthermore, elaborating slightly on the types of scenarios where memory leaks typically manifest (e.g., resource allocation without proper cleanup in loops or error handling) would add more depth.",
