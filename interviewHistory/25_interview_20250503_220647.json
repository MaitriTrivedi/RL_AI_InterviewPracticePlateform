    "answer": "A memory leak occurs when a program allocates memory but fails to release it when it is no longer needed, causing the program to consume more and more memory over time. This can eventually lead to performance degradation or system crashes, especially in long-running applications.\n\nSimple Scenario (in C or C++):\nIn C or C++, memory is manually managed using functions like malloc and free. A memory leak can occur if memory is allocated but not freed properly.\n\nExample:\n\nc\nCopy\nEdit\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nvoid createMemoryLeak() {\n    int *arr = (int*)malloc(100 * sizeof(int));  // Allocate memory for 100 integers\n    // Do something with arr...\n    // But forget to call free(arr); to release memory.\n}\n\nint main() {\n    while (1) {\n        createMemoryLeak();  // Continuously create memory leak\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\nIn this example:\n\nMemory is allocated for an array of 100 integers using malloc.\n\nHowever, the memory is never freed with free().\n\nAs the function createMemoryLeak() is called repeatedly in an infinite loop, memory continues to be allocated but never released, causing a memory leak.\n",

      "feedback": "The answer is excellent. It accurately defines a memory leak, explains its consequences, and provides a clear, concise, and runnable C code example demonstrating the issue. The explanation of the code is also well-written and easy to understand. The practical example highlights the importance of manual memory management in C/C++ and how easily leaks can occur.",
      "strengths": [
        "Accurate definition of a memory leak.",
        "Clear and understandable explanation of the problem and its consequences.",
        "Excellent C code example that directly demonstrates a memory leak.",
        "Code is runnable and well-commented.",
        "Correctly identifies the use of `malloc` and the omission of `free` as the source of the leak."
      ],
      "areas_for_improvement": [
        "While the example is great, it could benefit from briefly mentioning tools used to detect memory leaks (e.g., Valgrind) in C/C++.",
        "Could briefly mention strategies for preventing memory leaks (e.g. smart pointers in C++)"

      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "How can memory leaks be detected and debugged in C/C++? What tools are available?",
        "How do smart pointers in C++ help prevent memory leaks? Give an example."
