      "content": "Imagine you have a phone book sorted alphabetically by last name. You want to find the phone number of someone named 'Alice Smith'. Which search method would be most efficient, and why? Briefly explain what that method does.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "What would be a less efficient way to find Alice Smith's number in the phone book?",
        "Can you name another scenario where this efficient search method could be used?"
      ],
      "evaluation_points": [
        "Binary Search is the most efficient method",
        "Binary search involves repeatedly dividing the search interval in half."

    "evaluation": {
      "score": 0,
      "feedback": "The response 'I don't know' demonstrates a lack of understanding of basic search algorithms. The optimal approach for searching a sorted phone book is binary search. The answer fails to identify the correct algorithm, provide any explanation of its workings, or suggest any alternative approaches. It shows a complete lack of knowledge related to the question.",

      ],
      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Study the concept of binary search and its implementation.",
        "Compare and contrast binary search with linear search, considering their time complexities and suitability for different scenarios.",
        "Practice implementing binary search in a programming language."
