      "follow_up_questions": [
        "Could you walk me through the steps of sorting the list [5, 2, 8, 1, 9] using the algorithm you mentioned?",

    "evaluation": {
      "score": 7,
      "feedback": "The answer correctly identifies Bubble Sort as a simple algorithm suitable for a small list. However, it lacks a crucial element: a brief explanation *why* Bubble Sort is simple to implement and understand. The answer is technically correct but incomplete. While other algorithms like Insertion Sort could also be valid, Bubble Sort is a reasonable choice given the prompt. The response could be improved by adding a sentence or two explaining the core principle of Bubble Sort and why it's easy to grasp.",

        "Describe the basic steps of Bubble Sort in one or two sentences.",
        "Explain why the iterative comparison and swapping process in Bubble Sort is conceptually easy to understand."
