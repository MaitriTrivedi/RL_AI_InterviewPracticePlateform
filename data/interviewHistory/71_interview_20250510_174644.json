    "answer": "A **Trie** is an efficient tree-like data structure that is ideal for implementing autocomplete functionality. It stores words character by character, allowing for quick retrieval of word prefixes.\n\n### Steps to implement autocomplete using a Trie:\n\n1. **Construct the Trie**: Insert all words from the dictionary into the Trie. Each node represents a character, and each path down the tree forms a word. Mark the end of a word with a special marker (e.g., `is_end=True`).\n\n2. **Traverse the Trie for Prefix**: Given a partially entered string (e.g., \"appl\"), start at the root of the Trie and traverse the tree character by character, following the path that matches the prefix.\n\n3. **Collect Suggestions**: Once the prefix is found, use a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to collect all words that start with that prefix. Traverse down from the current node to all possible leaf nodes, appending characters to the prefix to form complete words.\n\n4. **Return Results**: Return the list of suggestions (words) that match the prefix.\n\n### Example:\n\n* Dictionary: \\[\"apple\", \"appetizer\", \"applause\", \"banana\"]\n* Input: \"appl\"\n* Traverse Trie, reach node representing \"l\", then collect all words starting from that point: \\[\"apple\", \"appetizer\", \"applause\"].\n\n### Efficiency:\n\n* **Time complexity for insert**: O(L), where L is the length of the word.\n* **Time complexity for autocomplete**: O(P + W), where P is the length of the prefix and W is the number of suggestions returned.\n\nThis structure allows for fast lookups and efficient prefix-based searches.\n",

      "feedback": "The answer provides a good overview of using a Trie for autocomplete. It correctly describes the Trie structure, the traversal process, and the collection of suggestions. The time complexity analysis is also accurate. However, the explanation could be more detailed regarding the DFS/BFS traversal for collecting suggestions and the implementation details of the `is_end` marker. While the example is helpful, it could benefit from showing the Trie structure visually or at least more details of the structure at each step. It also glosses over how the search actually constructs the words during the DFS/BFS step. More detailed pseudocode or explanation of the collection process would further enhance the answer.",
