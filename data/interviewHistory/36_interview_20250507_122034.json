      "subtopic": "API Design",
      "difficulty": 10.0,
      "content": "Imagine you are designing a highly scalable, distributed API for a global financial institution that handles interbank transfers. This API must support extremely high transaction volumes, low latency (sub-50ms for 99.99% of requests), and absolute data consistency. Furthermore, regulatory requirements mandate detailed audit logs for every transaction and strict compliance with GDPR (including the right to be forgotten). Specifically, design the API endpoints, data structures, and underlying architectural considerations (including queuing, data storage, and consistency mechanisms) needed to support the following functionality:\n\n1.  Initiate a transfer between two banks, specifying the source bank, destination bank, amount, currency, and purpose.\n2.  Query the status of a specific transfer by its unique ID.\n3.  Process a transfer (called by an internal settlement service, not exposed externally).\n4.  Redact all personal data associated with a transfer, adhering to GDPR requirements while preserving the transaction's integrity for auditing purposes. The redaction should not impact the accuracy of financial records.\n\nDescribe the tradeoffs you would consider in designing this API, especially concerning performance, consistency, security, and compliance.",

        "How would you handle eventual consistency issues when querying transfer status if the transaction involves multiple microservices?",
