      "difficulty": 1.1,
      "content": "Explain what a tree data structure is and give a simple, real-world example of where trees are used.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "What are the main components of a tree (like the root and nodes)?",
        "Can you describe the relationship between a parent node and a child node in a tree?"

        "Hierarchical structure",
        "Root, node, edges, and leaves",

    },
    "answer": "A **tree data structure** is a hierarchical model consisting of nodes connected by edges, where each node has a value and zero or more child nodes. It starts with a root node and branches out into sub-nodes, forming a tree-like structure. Trees are used in various applications, such as file systems, where directories (nodes) can contain subdirectories or files (child nodes). For example, in a computer's file explorer, the root is the top-level directory, and beneath it, you have various folders and files, forming a tree structure. This allows efficient organization and retrieval of files.\n",
    "evaluation": {
      "score": 8,
      "feedback": "The answer provides a good overview of tree data structures and a relevant real-world example. The explanation includes key components like nodes, edges, root, and child nodes, and correctly identifies the hierarchical nature of trees. The file system example is accurate and easy to understand. However, it could be improved by explicitly mentioning the parent-child relationship between nodes and leaves. Also, while the explanation includes that each node has a value, it could be emphasized that the value's type can vary depending on the specific application.",

        "Correctly identifies the hierarchical nature of tree data structures.",
        "Provides a clear and understandable definition of nodes, edges, and root node.",
        "Offers a relevant and easy-to-understand example of a file system as a tree structure.",
        "Demonstrates understanding of child nodes and their relationship to parent nodes."
      ],
      "areas_for_improvement": [
        "Could explicitly mention and define the 'parent-child' relationship in more detail.",
        "Could explicitly define what leaves are.",
        "The answer could elaborate on different types of trees, such as binary trees, or briefly mention other common applications beyond file systems."
      ],
      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Explain the difference between a tree and a binary tree.",
        "Describe other data structures that are related to trees, such as graphs, and explain the differences.",
        "How would you search for a specific file in the file system tree you described? (This can lead to discussion of different tree traversal algorithms)"
