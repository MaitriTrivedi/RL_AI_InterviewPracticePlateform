      "difficulty": 10.0,
      "content": "Consider a distributed microservices architecture where services A, B, and C are involved in a saga pattern to manage a transaction that requires operations across these services. Service A initiates the transaction. During the execution, service B successfully completes its operation, but service C fails midway through its operation. Service A then initiates compensation transactions for both service B and itself. However, due to network issues, the compensation transaction sent to service B fails to reach service B, and service A crashes before it can retry. Service B, unaware of the failure in service C, retains the state of its successfully completed operation. Later, service A recovers and starts its retry mechanism. Analyze the potential issues that can arise from this scenario. Specifically, discuss how to handle eventual consistency, idempotency, and the 'lost compensation' problem to ensure data integrity and system reliability, focusing on a solution that guarantees at-least-once compensation delivery without introducing duplicate compensations at service B.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "How would you design a message broker setup (e.g., Kafka) to specifically address the at-least-once compensation delivery guarantee, considering message ordering and potential duplicates?",
        "What mechanisms (e.g., database-level techniques, application-level constructs) would you employ in service B to ensure idempotency of both the original transaction and the compensation transaction, given the possibility of receiving the compensation message multiple times?",
        "How would you monitor and alert on the state of these transactions and compensations, allowing for manual intervention if the automated retry mechanism fails or encounters persistent errors?"

      "feedback": "The candidate stated they do not know the answer. This indicates a complete lack of understanding of the concepts involved: saga pattern, distributed transactions, eventual consistency, idempotency, and reliable messaging. No relevant information or problem-solving skills were demonstrated. The answer fails to address any aspect of the question.",
