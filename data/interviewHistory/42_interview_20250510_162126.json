      "difficulty": 2.8175,
      "content": "Imagine you are processing a stream of website traffic data. You need to identify the maximum number of unique users who visited the site within any given consecutive 5-minute window. Given an array `visits` where each element represents the timestamp (in minutes from the start) of a visit from a unique user, write a function `max_unique_users(visits)` that returns the maximum number of unique users in any 5-minute window. For example, `visits = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]` should return 10 (from timestamps 1 to 10). You can assume that the `visits` array is sorted in ascending order.  Consider optimizing for cases where the visit stream is very large.",
