      "content": "Explain the core concept behind Segment Trees. In what scenarios would you consider using a Segment Tree, even for a small static array? Provide a simple example with an array of size 4 and show how the Segment Tree would be structured to calculate the sum of elements in any sub-range.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "What is the height of a complete Segment Tree built on an array of size 'n'?",
