      "difficulty": 4.76,
      "content": "Imagine you are designing a system for processing user-uploaded images. The system needs to resize images into multiple sizes for different display purposes (thumbnail, medium, large). Each image resize operation takes a variable amount of time depending on the image size and complexity. Without message queues, you might resize the images serially, making the user wait longer. Explain how you could use a message queue to improve the user experience and system performance in this scenario. Specifically, describe:\n\n1.  The components of your system (e.g., upload service, image processor).\n2.  How the message queue integrates with these components.\n3.  The data structure of a typical message you would enqueue.\n4.  What considerations would you have when choosing a message queue technology (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka, SQS)?",

        "What happens if an image processing worker fails to process an image? How would you handle this scenario to ensure no images are lost?",
