      "subtopic": "System Architecture",
      "difficulty": 5.645081843911757,
      "content": "A rapidly growing e-commerce company is experiencing frequent database bottlenecks during peak hours (e.g., flash sales, holidays). Currently, they are using a single, powerful relational database instance to handle all read and write operations. Describe a system architecture that addresses this bottleneck while ensuring data consistency. Specifically, outline the components you would include, the data replication strategy you would employ, and the trade-offs involved in your chosen approach.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "How would you monitor the performance of this new architecture and identify potential issues?",
        "What considerations would you take into account for data consistency in the event of a failure in one of the read replicas?",
        "How would you handle schema changes with this architecture?"
      ],
      "evaluation_points": [
        "Read replicas or database sharding (or combination) to improve read performance",
        "Understanding of eventual consistency vs strong consistency and the trade-offs of each",
        "Understanding of database replication strategies (e.g., synchronous vs asynchronous)",
        "Importance of monitoring and metrics",
        "Ability to discuss CAP theorem considerations in this context"

      "feedback": "The candidate indicated that they did not know the answer. Therefore, they demonstrated no understanding of database architecture, replication strategies, consistency models, or the CAP theorem in the context of scaling a relational database for an e-commerce application. There was no opportunity to assess their ability to design a system, explain trade-offs, or discuss practical considerations like monitoring.",

        "Familiarity with database replication strategies (e.g., synchronous replication, asynchronous replication).",

        "Understanding of monitoring and metrics for database performance."

      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Research database scaling techniques for read-heavy workloads, focusing on read replicas and sharding.",
        "Study different consistency models and their impact on application behavior.",
        "Explore the CAP theorem and its relevance to distributed database design.",
        "Practice designing database architectures for e-commerce applications, considering trade-offs between consistency, availability, and performance."
