      "difficulty": 8,
      "content": "You are designing a traffic management system for a large city. The system needs to handle various types of vehicles, including cars, trucks, motorcycles, and autonomous drones. Each vehicle type has different properties (e.g., size, speed limits, emission rates) and requires different processing by the system's central control unit. The system must efficiently manage traffic flow, optimize routes, and respond to incidents such as accidents or congestion. \n\nDescribe a design that leverages polymorphism to effectively handle these diverse vehicle types. Consider the following:\n\n1.  Define a base class or interface and relevant subclasses representing each vehicle type, highlighting the polymorphic methods you would implement.\n2.  Explain how your design handles vehicle-specific logic (e.g., calculating tolls based on vehicle size, determining optimal routes based on vehicle type, processing data from vehicle-specific sensors).\n3.  Discuss how you would handle adding new vehicle types to the system in the future with minimal code changes and without breaking existing functionality. Pay attention to open/closed principle.\n4.  Explain how your polymorphic design would scale to handle a large number of vehicles and complex traffic scenarios. Consider the performance implications of using polymorphism and propose potential optimizations (e.g., using virtual tables efficiently, caching strategy, avoiding unnecessary object creation).\n5.  What are the potential drawbacks or limitations of your polymorphic approach, and how might you mitigate them (consider the limitations of single dispatch in many languages)? Could you potentially use double dispatch or other design patterns to solve those?",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "How would you handle situations where a vehicle needs to be dynamically reassigned to a different vehicle type (e.g., a truck temporarily classified as a 'heavy goods transport' for priority routing)?",
        "What are the testing strategies you would use to ensure the correctness and robustness of your polymorphic traffic management system?",
        "How would you serialize and deserialize the vehicle objects while preserving their polymorphic type information for persistence or inter-process communication?"

      "feedback": "The candidate stated they don't know the answer. Therefore, no technical concepts were presented, no solution was proposed, and no consideration of trade-offs or optimizations was offered. The candidate provided no basis for evaluation against the stated criteria. A complete lack of response implies a lack of understanding of the underlying principles of object-oriented design, polymorphism, and software architecture.",
