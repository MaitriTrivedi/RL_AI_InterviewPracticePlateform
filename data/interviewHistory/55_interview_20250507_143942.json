      "content": "Imagine you are building a system to track the availability of rooms in a hotel. Each room can be either available (1) or occupied (0). You need to frequently answer queries about the total number of available rooms within a specific range of room numbers (e.g., rooms 10 to 25). The occupancy status of individual rooms also changes frequently. Describe how you would use a Segment Tree to efficiently handle these queries and updates. Provide a high-level explanation of the tree structure and how the sum query and update operations would work. No need to write actual code, but focus on the algorithm.",

        "What is the time complexity of the sum query and update operations in your Segment Tree implementation?",
        "How would you handle a scenario where the number of rooms is very large (e.g., millions), potentially leading to memory issues? Could you suggest any optimizations or alternative data structures if a simple Segment Tree isn't suitable?"

    "answer": "To track room availability efficiently using a **Segment Tree**:\n\n### Tree Structure:\n\n* **Leaf nodes** represent the availability of individual rooms (1 for available, 0 for occupied).\n* **Internal nodes** store the sum of availability for a range of rooms, i.e., the total number of available rooms in that range.\n\n### Operations:\n\n1. **Sum Query**:\n\n   * To find the total number of available rooms in a range (e.g., rooms 10 to 25), the segment tree is traversed to sum the values of relevant leaf nodes. Internal nodes are combined during traversal to get the sum efficiently in **O(log n)** time.\n2. **Update**:\n\n   * When the status of a room changes (e.g., a room becomes available or occupied), the corresponding leaf node is updated. The change propagates up the tree, updating all relevant internal nodes in **O(log n)** time.\n\n### Benefits:\n\n* **Query Time**: Each query (e.g., number of available rooms in a range) is answered in **O(log n)**.\n* **Update Time**: Any status change (room available/occupied) is handled in **O(log n)**.\n",

      "feedback": "The answer provides a good high-level overview of using a Segment Tree for the room availability problem. The explanation of the tree structure and the basic concepts of the sum query and update operations are correct. However, the explanation lacks specific details on *how* the tree is traversed during query and update operations. For example, it doesn't explain the divide-and-conquer strategy of the query and update, or how to handle cases where the query range only partially overlaps with a node's range. While it correctly mentions logarithmic time complexity, it doesn't delve into why or how the algorithm achieves this complexity.",
