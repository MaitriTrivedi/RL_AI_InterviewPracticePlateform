      "difficulty": 3.6,
      "content": "Imagine you're building a simple system to represent different types of vehicles. You need to represent cars and bicycles. Create two classes, `Car` and `Bicycle`. Both should have a method called `move()` that prints a message indicating how the vehicle is moving (e.g., \"Car is driving.\" or \"Bicycle is pedaling.\"). Also, the `Car` class should have an attribute called `num_doors` and a corresponding constructor argument to set this value, and the `Bicycle` class should have an attribute called `has_basket` (a boolean) and a corresponding constructor argument. Provide code snippets demonstrating the creation of these classes and the calling of the `move()` method for instances of each class.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "How could you avoid code duplication between the `Car` and `Bicycle` classes?",
        "What are some other attributes you might add to each of these classes, and why would they be useful?"

        "Correct class definition and instantiation.",

      "score": 10,
      "feedback": "The answer is excellent. It demonstrates a strong understanding of object-oriented programming principles. The code is technically accurate, complete, and clearly presented. The classes `Car` and `Bicycle` are correctly defined with appropriate attributes and constructors. The `move()` method is implemented correctly for both classes. The instantiation and calling of the `move()` method are also perfectly executed. The code is well-commented and easy to understand, contributing to the clarity and practical application of the concepts.",
