      "content": "You have a stored procedure `UpdateProductStock` that takes two parameters: `@ProductID` (INT) and `@QuantityChange` (INT). This procedure updates the `StockQuantity` column in the `Products` table. The initial version of the stored procedure doesn't include any error handling. Describe how you would add basic error handling to this stored procedure to prevent it from crashing if, for example, the `@ProductID` doesn't exist, or the resulting `StockQuantity` would be negative. Provide SQL snippets demonstrating the error handling you would implement. Assume you're using SQL Server.",

    "evaluation": {
      "score": 8,
      "feedback": "The answer provides a solid implementation of error handling within the stored procedure. It effectively uses TRY...CATCH blocks, checks for both non-existent ProductIDs and negative stock quantities. The use of `THROW` for custom errors and re-throwing the original error in the `CATCH` block is good practice. However, the answer could benefit from including transaction handling to ensure data consistency and providing more structured error reporting beyond just `PRINT` statements.",
      "strengths": [
        "Correct usage of TRY...CATCH block for error handling.",
        "Includes checks for non-existent ProductID and prevents negative StockQuantity.",
        "Uses THROW to raise custom errors and re-throws the original error in the CATCH block, preserving the error information.",
        "Clear and understandable code."
      ],
      "areas_for_improvement": [
        "Missing transaction handling: The update operation should be wrapped in a transaction to ensure atomicity. If an error occurs during the update, the transaction should be rolled back to prevent partial updates.",
        "Error reporting could be improved: Using `PRINT` statements for error messages is acceptable for basic debugging, but a more robust approach would involve returning an error code or using `RAISERROR` with severity levels for better logging and monitoring.",
        "The `THROW @ErrorSeverity, @ErrorMessage, @ErrorState;` syntax is technically incorrect; the first argument of `THROW` must be a *state* number (0-255), not a severity. It should be replaced by `THROW 50000, @ErrorMessage, 1;` or an equivalent method that provides a state number."
      ],
      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Incorporate transaction handling using `BEGIN TRANSACTION`, `COMMIT TRANSACTION`, and `ROLLBACK TRANSACTION` within the stored procedure.",
        "Explore the use of `RAISERROR` instead of `PRINT` for more detailed and configurable error reporting.",
        "Correct the use of `THROW` and replace `@ErrorSeverity` with an appropriate state number (e.g., 1) as the first argument.",
        "Consider adding logging functionality to record errors for auditing and debugging purposes."
