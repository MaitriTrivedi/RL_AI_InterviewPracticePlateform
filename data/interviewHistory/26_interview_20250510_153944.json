      "content": "You are designing a rate limiter for an e-commerce website to protect the checkout API from abuse. The initial rate limiter implementation uses a single in-memory counter for all users, allowing a maximum of 10 requests per minute. The system is experiencing increased traffic, and this global rate limit is causing legitimate users to be blocked. How would you modify the rate limiter to allow for individual user rate limiting while still maintaining the overall system's stability and preventing abuse?",

    "answer": "To modify the rate limiter and ensure that legitimate users are not blocked while still maintaining system stability and preventing abuse, we can implement per-user rate limiting rather than a global rate limit. This ensures that each user is subject to their own set of limits, which can help prevent one user from affecting others. Here are the steps to achieve this:\n\n1. Per-User Rate Limiting with Unique Identifiers:\nInstead of using a global counter for all users, use the user's unique identifier (such as their user ID or IP address) to track requests.\n\nEach user will have their own counter that tracks how many requests they\u2019ve made within a specific time window (e.g., 10 requests per minute).\n\n2. Implement a Sliding Window or Token Bucket Algorithm:\nSliding Window or Token Bucket algorithms are commonly used for rate limiting as they allow for more flexibility and fairness than a simple fixed window counter.\n\nSliding Window:\n\nThe sliding window algorithm allows for a dynamic time window (e.g., the last 60 seconds).\n\nEach request by a user is timestamped, and the rate limiter checks how many requests the user has made within the last 60 seconds.\n\nAs time progresses, the window \"slides,\" and expired requests are removed from the count, allowing new requests if the user hasn\u2019t exceeded the limit.\n\nToken Bucket:\n\nA token bucket has a fixed \"bucket\" size (e.g., 10 tokens for 10 requests per minute).\n\nTokens are added to the bucket at a fixed rate (e.g., 1 token per minute).\n\nEach request consumes one token from the bucket. If the bucket is empty (i.e., the user has exceeded their rate limit), the request is denied.\n\nThis approach allows for bursts of traffic but ensures that the user cannot exceed the set rate over a longer period.\n\n3. Distributed Storage for Rate Limiting (Optional for Scalability):\nIf your system is distributed (e.g., multiple servers), using distributed caching systems like Redis or Memcached can store the individual counters for each user.\n\nRedis, in particular, is a great choice because it supports atomic operations, so the rate limiting logic (like incrementing counters and checking expiration) can be handled safely across multiple instances.\n\nYou could use Redis' hashes or sorted sets to store user request counts, ensuring that each user\u2019s data is isolated but accessible from any instance in your system.\n\n4. Define Rate Limit and Time Window:\nSet a reasonable rate limit that balances user experience and protection. For example, you can allow 10 requests per minute for each user, but this can be adjusted based on the type of traffic and user behavior.\n\nIf the traffic increases, you might decide to reduce the rate (e.g., 5 requests per minute) or extend the time window (e.g., 10 requests per 5 minutes).\n\n5. Handle Rate Limit Exceeding Gracefully:\nWhen a user exceeds their rate limit, return a 429 Too Many Requests HTTP response with information about when they can try again (e.g., \"Retry-After\" header).\n\nProvide users with a way to be informed of their rate limit status without affecting the overall user experience.\n\n6. Rate Limiting for Specific API Endpoints:\nIf some endpoints (like checkout) are more sensitive to abuse than others (e.g., browsing products), you can apply different rate limits for specific APIs.\n\nFor example, you might want to allow 20 requests per minute for browsing product pages, but limit checkout requests to 10 requests per minute per user.\n\nExample of Implementation with Redis (Token Bucket):\nSet up Redis to store per-user counters:\n\nEach user will have a unique key like rate_limit:{user_id}, and Redis will store the number of requests made in the current time window.\n\nUse the INCRBY and EXPIRE commands to track requests and set the expiration time for the window.\n\nToken Bucket Approach:\n\nEvery time the user makes a request:\n\nCheck if there are tokens available (e.g., check the count for rate_limit:{user_id}).\n\nIf tokens are available, decrement the counter and process the request.\n\nIf tokens are not available, return a 429 Too Many Requests response.\n\nPeriodically replenish tokens (e.g., one token every minute).",
