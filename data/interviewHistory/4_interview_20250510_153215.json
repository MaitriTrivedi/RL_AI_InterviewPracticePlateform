      "difficulty": 3.879471055272967,
      "content": "You are building a simple search feature for a library database. The database contains a list of books, each represented as a string of the book title. The book titles are sorted alphabetically. Given a search query (a string), you need to find if a book with that title exists in the library database. Implement a function that efficiently searches for the book title in the database. You must use Binary Search.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "What is the time complexity of your solution?",
        "How would you handle cases where the search query is a prefix of an existing book title? Should it return true in that scenario?"

      "feedback": "The submitted answer 'bjadb' is completely inadequate for the question. It does not represent any attempt at implementing a binary search algorithm or any relevant code. It shows no understanding of the problem or how to approach it. The student did not provide any code, pseudocode, or explanation of their thought process.",
