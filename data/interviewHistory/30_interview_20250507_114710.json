      "difficulty": 1.3255893822436366,
      "content": "Imagine you have an array of sales data for a week, say `[10, 5, 12, 7, 15, 8, 9]`. We want to quickly find the total sales for any given day or range of days. Explain how a Segment Tree can be used to pre-process this data so you can efficiently compute the sum of sales within any range.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "What is the height of a segment tree built on an array of size n?",
        "What are the advantages of using a Segment Tree over simply iterating through the array for each range query?"
      ],
      "evaluation_points": [
        "Segment tree structure (binary tree)",
        "Each node represents a range",
        "Leaf nodes represent individual elements",
        "Parent nodes store aggregate information (sum in this case) of their children",
        "Pre-processing/building the tree"
      ],
      "expected_time_minutes": 7
    },
    "answer": "A **Segment Tree** is a binary tree used to store sums of ranges in an array. \n\n### Steps:\n1. **Build the Tree**: Store the array elements in leaf nodes. Internal nodes store the sum of their respective ranges (e.g., sum of sales for days 1-2, 3-4, etc.).\n2. **Query**: To get the sum of sales for a range (e.g., days 2 to 5), the segment tree combines sums from relevant nodes in **O(log n)** time.\n3. **Update**: If sales change for a day, the tree can be updated in **O(log n)** time.\n\n**Benefit**: Efficient range queries and updates (both **O(log n)**) compared to recalculating sums directly.",

      "score": 7,
      "feedback": "The answer provides a high-level overview of Segment Trees and their application to the sales data problem. It correctly identifies the core concepts like building the tree, querying, and updating, along with the logarithmic time complexity for these operations. However, it lacks detail on how the tree is constructed, specifically the recursive nature of building the tree and how ranges are split at each node. Also, it needs to elaborate more on the query process -- how the relevant nodes are selected based on the given range. Finally, the connection to the initial array of `[10, 5, 12, 7, 15, 8, 9]` is not explicitly demonstrated; an example explaining how the tree would be structured based on this array would enhance the answer.",
      "strengths": [
        "Correctly identifies Segment Tree as a suitable data structure.",
        "Accurately states the time complexity for query and update operations.",
        "Provides a general understanding of the building, querying, and updating processes."

      "areas_for_improvement": [
        "Lacks detail on the recursive construction of the Segment Tree.",
        "Does not clearly explain the range splitting strategy during tree construction.",
        "Missing explanation of how query identifies and combines relevant nodes for a given range.",
        "No concrete example based on the given sales data array to illustrate the Segment Tree's structure."
      ],
      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Explain the recursive algorithm for building a Segment Tree, including how ranges are divided at each node.",
        "Provide a more detailed walkthrough of the query process, focusing on how the relevant nodes are selected and their sums combined to answer a range query.",
        "Illustrate the structure of the Segment Tree using the example array [10, 5, 12, 7, 15, 8, 9] to clarify how values are stored at different nodes."
