      "feedback": "The answer provides a code snippet demonstrating routing in React using `react-router-dom`. While the code is correct and shows a basic routing setup, it doesn't actually *explain* what routing is in general terms, or *why* it's important. The answer dives directly into an implementation detail (React code) without addressing the conceptual aspects of the question. It correctly shows how the `/about` path can be linked to the `AboutPage` component. However, it lacks the high-level explanation needed to demonstrate a fundamental understanding of routing concepts independent of React.",
