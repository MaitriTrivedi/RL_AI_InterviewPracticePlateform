      "subtopic": "Linked Lists",
      "difficulty": 3.0,
      "content": "Imagine you are creating a music playlist application. You want to implement a 'next song' feature. Which data structure, between an Array and a Singly Linked List, would be more efficient for quickly navigating to the next song in the playlist, and why? Assume you only need to move forward in the playlist (no 'previous song' functionality initially).",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "What are the time complexities of accessing the next element in an array versus a singly linked list?",
        "What is the main advantage of using a Linked List in terms of memory management, compared to an Array?"

      "evaluation_points": [
        "Singly Linked List",
        "O(1) time complexity for moving to the next element in a Linked List when you have a reference to the current node.",
        "Arrays might require resizing which can be costly, while linked lists are dynamic."

    "evaluation": {
      "score": 0,
      "feedback": "The candidate stated they do not know the answer, indicating a lack of knowledge on fundamental data structures and their performance characteristics. The question tests understanding of Arrays and Singly Linked Lists in a practical scenario. A correct answer would have discussed the O(1) time complexity of accessing the next element in a linked list when a pointer to the current element exists, contrasted with potentially less efficient operations in an array (although, simple incrementing an index in an array is also O(1) assuming the playlist is pre-loaded). The answer missed the opportunity to demonstrate knowledge of time complexity and data structure trade-offs.",

      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Review the concepts of Arrays and Singly Linked Lists, focusing on their memory layout and the time complexity of insertion, deletion, and access operations.",
        "Practice solving similar problems that require choosing the appropriate data structure based on performance requirements."
