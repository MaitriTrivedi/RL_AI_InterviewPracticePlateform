      "content": "Imagine you're setting up routing for a simple website with two pages: a homepage (/) and an about page (/about).  Describe the basic routing configuration needed. Explain how the application knows to display the homepage content when a user navigates to the root URL ('/') and the about page content when the user navigates to '/about'.",

        "What happens if a user tries to access a route that isn't defined, like '/contact'?",

    },
    "answer": "To set up routing for a simple website with a homepage (`/`) and an about page (`/about`), you'd configure routes in the web application's router.\n\nFor example, in **Express.js** (Node.js):\n\n```js\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\n\napp.get('/', (req, res) => {\n  res.send('Homepage Content');\n});\n\napp.get('/about', (req, res) => {\n  res.send('About Page Content');\n});\n\napp.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));\n```\n\n### How it works:\n\n* When a user navigates to `/`, the app matches the `app.get('/', ...)` route and sends the homepage content.\n* When a user navigates to `/about`, the app matches `app.get('/about', ...)` and sends the about page content.\n\nThe router maps specific URL paths to the corresponding handler functions, determining which content to display based on the URL.\n",

      "score": 9,
      "feedback": "This is a strong answer. The candidate provides a clear and concise explanation of routing, supported by a practical example using Express.js. They accurately describe how the router matches URLs to handler functions and delivers the appropriate content. The 'How it works' section reinforces the understanding of the routing mechanism. The answer would be perfect with a brief mention of handling undefined routes or default routes.",
      "strengths": [
        "Accurate and relevant code example",

        "Good understanding of how the router directs requests"

      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "How would you handle a more complex routing scenario, such as routing based on parameters in the URL (e.g., /users/:id)?",
        "How would you implement error handling or middleware within this routing setup?"
