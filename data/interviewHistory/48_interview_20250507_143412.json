      "content": "Your company recently migrated its primary web application, `www.example.com`, to a new cloud provider. After the migration, users in a specific geographic region are still being directed to the old server for a significant amount of time, even after you've updated the DNS records at your authoritative DNS server. Explain the most likely cause of this issue, and describe the steps you would take to diagnose and resolve it. Consider the possible involvement of both DNS and DHCP in the troubleshooting process.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "How would you verify that the DNS record changes have propagated to different DNS servers around the world?",
        "What are some potential drawbacks of aggressively lowering the TTL (Time To Live) value on your DNS records?"
      ],
      "evaluation_points": [
        "DNS caching at various levels (local resolvers, ISP resolvers, recursive resolvers).",
        "Importance of Time-To-Live (TTL) values in DNS records.",

      "feedback": "The candidate stated that they don't know the answer, indicating a complete lack of understanding of the core concepts involved in DNS propagation and troubleshooting common DNS-related issues after a migration. They failed to demonstrate any awareness of DNS caching, TTL values, or the roles of different DNS servers. Furthermore, there was no attempt to formulate a troubleshooting plan or even identify potential causes. The answer does not address the question in any meaningful way.",

        "Differentiating between authoritative and recursive DNS servers and their respective roles.",
        "Comprehending how DNS resolution works and how updates propagate through the system.",
        "Developing troubleshooting methodologies for DNS-related problems.",
        "Understanding the potential indirect influence of DHCP lease times on client-side DNS caching (though less direct than other factors)."
      ],
      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Study the fundamentals of DNS, including the different types of DNS servers and their functions.",
        "Research DNS caching mechanisms and how TTL values affect cache expiration.",
        "Practice troubleshooting common DNS-related issues using online resources and lab environments.",
        "Review network troubleshooting tools like `dig`, `nslookup`, and `traceroute` to diagnose DNS problems."
