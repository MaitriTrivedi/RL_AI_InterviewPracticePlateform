      "content": "You are designing a system for managing a large, dynamically changing playlist of songs for a music streaming service. Due to memory constraints and frequent insertion/deletion operations at arbitrary positions within the playlist, you've decided to use a Linked List data structure. However, naive Linked List implementations suffer from O(n) time complexity for accessing elements at a specific index. To mitigate this, you propose a 'Skip List' based Linked List structure. \n\nImplement a `SkipLinkedList` class that extends a standard singly Linked List.  This `SkipLinkedList` should have 'skip' pointers at certain nodes to allow for faster traversal. Specifically, each node should have a probability 'p' (e.g., 0.5) of having a 'skip' pointer to the node 'k' positions ahead in the list, where 'k' is determined by a probabilistic function. The higher the node, the fewer nodes are at that level. Your solution should include methods for:\n\n1.  `insertAt(index, value)`: Inserts a new node with the given value at the specified index. The insertion process should also probabilistically determine if and where the new node should have skip pointers. You are free to use an external library for random number generation.\n2.  `getAt(index)`: Retrieves the value of the node at the specified index. Utilize the skip pointers to optimize traversal whenever possible.\n3.  `deleteAt(index)`: Deletes the node at the specified index.  Update skip pointers if necessary after deletion to maintain the skip list structure.\n4.  `printSkipList()`: Prints the levels of SkipList with the nodes in each level. This helps to visualize the data structure (for debugging purpose).\n\nConsider the following constraints:\n*   Assume a uniform probability distribution for skip pointer creation (e.g., probability p = 0.5 for a node to have a skip pointer). Feel free to use appropriate random number generation libraries in your chosen language.\n*   Optimize for average-case performance of `getAt`, `insertAt`, and `deleteAt` using skip pointers.\n*   Pay attention to edge cases, such as inserting at the beginning or end of the list, or deleting the first or last element.\n*   Address potential memory management issues when deleting nodes with skip pointers.\n",
