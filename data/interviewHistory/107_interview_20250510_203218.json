      "content": "A small business has two separate departments, Sales and Marketing, each needing its own isolated network. They have purchased a single class C IP address block: 192.168.1.0/24. You need to subnet this block to create two subnets, one for Sales and one for Marketing. Sales requires a maximum of 60 usable IP addresses, while Marketing requires a maximum of 30 usable IP addresses. \n\n1.  What subnet masks would you use for each department's network?\n2.  What would be the network address, broadcast address, and range of usable IP addresses for each subnet?\n3.  What are the potential drawbacks, if any, of this subnetting design, considering future growth?",

    "answer": "### 1. **Subnet Masks for Each Department's Network:**\n\n* **Sales Network**: Requires 60 usable IP addresses.\n\n  * To support 60 usable IPs, we need 64 total addresses (including network and broadcast addresses).\n  * **Subnet Mask**: /26 (because 2^6 = 64 addresses)\n* **Marketing Network**: Requires 30 usable IP addresses.\n\n  * To support 30 usable IPs, we need 32 total addresses.\n  * **Subnet Mask**: /27 (because 2^5 = 32 addresses)\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Network Address, Broadcast Address, and Usable IP Ranges:**\n\n* **Sales Subnet** (192.168.1.0/26):\n\n  * **Network Address**: 192.168.1.0\n  * **Broadcast Address**: 192.168.1.63\n  * **Usable IP Range**: 192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.62\n\n* **Marketing Subnet** (192.168.1.64/27):\n\n  * **Network Address**: 192.168.1.64\n  * **Broadcast Address**: 192.168.1.95\n  * **Usable IP Range**: 192.168.1.65 - 192.168.1.94\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Potential Drawbacks of This Subnetting Design:**\n\n* **Limited Growth**: Both subnets have limited room for expansion. Sales can only scale up to 62 IPs, and Marketing to 30 IPs. This design won't accommodate future increases in department size without re-subnetting.\n\n* **Waste of Addresses**: The Marketing subnet (/27) has 2 IPs wasted (since only 30 are usable out of 32 total). However, this is a minor trade-off for precise addressing.\n\nTo address future growth, you may need to reconsider the subnet sizes or opt for a larger address block.\n\n",
    "evaluation": {
      "score": 9,
      "feedback": "The answer is technically accurate and well-explained. The subnet mask calculations, network addresses, broadcast addresses, and usable IP ranges are all correct. The discussion of the drawbacks is also accurate and relevant to the prompt. The solution is well organized and easy to follow. A minor improvement could involve suggesting alternative subnetting designs or technologies (like VLANs) to better support future growth and address limitations of a single class C block.",

        "Could briefly suggest alternative solutions for scalability, such as VLANs in addition to subnetting or obtaining a larger address block, demonstrating a broader understanding of networking options."

        "Explain how VLANs could be used in this scenario as an alternative or complementary solution to subnetting.",
        "How would the solution change if the business was projected to grow to 200 employees in each department within the next year?",
        "Discuss the difference between classful and classless subnetting."
