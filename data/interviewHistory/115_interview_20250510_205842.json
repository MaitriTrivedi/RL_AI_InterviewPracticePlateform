    "answer": "In programming, a **String** is a data type used to represent a sequence of characters, such as words, sentences, or any combination of text. Strings are typically enclosed in quotation marks (`\" \"` or `' '`), and they can store text data like names, addresses, or any textual information.\n\n### Example:\n\nHere\u2019s a simple example of how you might use a String to store a name in a programming language like Java:\n\n```java\n// Declaring a String variable to store a name\nString name = \"John Doe\";\n\n// Printing the name to the console\nSystem.out.println(name);\n```\n\nIn this example, the String `\"John Doe\"` is stored in the variable `name`, and then it's printed to the console.\n",

      "score": 9,
      "feedback": "The answer is very good. The definition of a String is accurate and complete, clearly stating that it represents a sequence of characters and giving examples of what can be stored in it. The example provided is clear, concise, and in a commonly used language (Java), making it easy to understand how a String can be used to store a name. The code example is well-commented, improving readability. The choice to show the declaration, assignment, and printing of the string provides a complete picture.",

        "Accurate and clear definition of a String.",

      "areas_for_improvement": [
        "Could briefly mention the immutability of Strings in some languages (like Java) for a more comprehensive understanding, though this isn't strictly required for the basic definition.",
        "While Java is a great example, briefly mentioning how Strings are handled in another language (e.g., Python where they're very similar) could broaden the answer."
      ],
      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Explain the concept of String immutability and its implications in Java.",
        "Compare and contrast String handling in different programming languages (e.g., Java vs. Python).",
        "Ask about common String operations like concatenation, substring extraction, and searching."
