      "content": "You are designing a system to manage different types of notifications for a service. You have identified three main types of notifications: `EmailNotification`, `SMSNotification`, and `PushNotification`. Each notification type requires a `send()` method. They all share some common attributes: `recipient`, `message`, and `timestamp`. However, the `send()` implementation varies for each type. For example, `EmailNotification` uses SMTP, `SMSNotification` uses a messaging API, and `PushNotification` uses a push notification service. \n\n1.  Design a class hierarchy using inheritance to represent these notification types, including the shared attributes and the specialized `send()` method. The base class should be abstract if necessary. The `send()` method in each subclass should print a statement indicating the type of notification and its content (e.g., 'Sending Email to user@example.com with message: Hello!').\n2.  You want to add a feature to track the delivery status of each notification (e.g., 'sent', 'failed', 'pending'). Where and how would you incorporate this functionality into your existing class hierarchy in the most efficient and maintainable way? Consider that all notifications should have this status, and the status might need to be accessed and updated after the `send()` method is called.\n3. Explain which design patterns would apply to improve the design of this solution further, given that more notification types could be added in the future, potentially causing the base class to become too complex.",

    "answer": "To design a system that manages different types of notifications, we can use inheritance to create a base class `Notification` and subclass it into specific types such as `EmailNotification`, `SMSNotification`, and `PushNotification`. The base class will include the common attributes (`recipient`, `message`, `timestamp`) and an abstract `send()` method that will be implemented in each subclass. The `send()` method in each subclass will handle the specific way each notification is sent, while printing out a message indicating the notification type and content. Here's how this would look:\n\n```python\nfrom abc import ABC, abstractmethod\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\nclass Notification(ABC):\n    def __init__(self, recipient, message):\n        self.recipient = recipient\n        self.message = message\n        self.timestamp = datetime.now()\n        self.status = 'pending'  # Initial status is pending\n\n    @abstractmethod\n    def send(self):\n        pass\n\nclass EmailNotification(Notification):\n    def send(self):\n        print(f\"Sending Email to {self.recipient} with message: {self.message}\")\n        self.status = 'sent'\n\nclass SMSNotification(Notification):\n    def send(self):\n        print(f\"Sending SMS to {self.recipient} with message: {self.message}\")\n        self.status = 'sent'\n\nclass PushNotification(Notification):\n    def send(self):\n        print(f\"Sending Push Notification to {self.recipient} with message: {self.message}\")\n        self.status = 'sent'\n```\n\nThis design ensures that all notification types inherit the shared attributes and method (`send()`), while allowing each subclass to implement its own logic for sending the respective notification type.\n\nTo track the delivery status, we can add a `status` attribute in the base class `Notification`. The status starts as `'pending'`, and after calling the `send()` method in any subclass, it is updated to `'sent'`. If there were an error during the send process, the status could be set to `'failed'`. This way, the status is tracked centrally in the base class, making it easy to manage and access for any notification type.\n\nFor further extensibility, especially as more notification types are added, we could employ the **Strategy pattern**. This pattern allows us to define a family of algorithms (in this case, the different `send()` implementations for each notification type) and make them interchangeable. Instead of having a growing number of `send()` implementations in the base class, we could create separate strategies for each notification type's sending behavior, making it easier to extend the system without modifying existing code. Additionally, using the **Template Method pattern** would help structure the steps involved in sending a notification, where common logic (e.g., updating the status) is defined in the base class, while the specific sending behavior is handled in the subclasses. These patterns help keep the design flexible and maintainable as the system scales and new notification types are added.\n",

      "score": 8,
      "feedback": "The solution demonstrates a good understanding of inheritance and abstract classes. The implementation of the notification hierarchy is correct, and the `send()` method is properly overridden in the subclasses. The addition of the `status` attribute in the base class for tracking delivery status is also well-placed. The explanation of the Strategy and Template Method patterns is accurate, and their potential application for improving extensibility is well-considered. However, the answer could benefit from a more concrete illustration of how the Strategy pattern would be implemented in code within the context of this problem. It would also be beneficial to mention the Factory pattern as a potential way to instantiate different notification types more elegantly.",
