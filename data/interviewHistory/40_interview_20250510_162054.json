      "difficulty": 3.5,
      "content": "Imagine you're building a simple URL shortening service (like bit.ly). Initially, you anticipate only a few hundred requests per day. However, you expect it to grow significantly over time, potentially to millions of requests daily. Describe a basic strategy you would use to handle the increased load as the service becomes more popular. Specifically, focus on how you would horizontally scale the read operations (accessing the shortened URLs).",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "What are some potential bottlenecks you might encounter as the request volume increases?",
        "What are the trade-offs between using a simple in-memory cache and a more robust caching solution like Redis?"

      "evaluation_points": [
        "Horizontal scaling (adding more servers)",
        "Caching strategy (e.g., using a CDN or in-memory cache)",

      "feedback": "The answer \"i do not know\" provides no information about the student's understanding of horizontal scaling, caching, load balancing, or read replicas. It demonstrates a complete lack of knowledge regarding the requested concepts and problem. This answer is unacceptable for a technical interview scenario requiring a basic understanding of system design principles.",

        "Learn about load balancing algorithms and technologies (e.g., Round Robin, HAProxy, Nginx).",
