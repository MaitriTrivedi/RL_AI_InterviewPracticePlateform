      "topic": null,
      "subtopic": "OSI Model",
      "difficulty": 1.1,
      "content": "When you browse a website, like Google.com, which layer of the OSI model is primarily responsible for translating the human-readable domain name (Google.com) into an IP address that computers can understand?",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "What is an IP address?",
        "Can you name another layer of the OSI model and briefly describe its function?"

      "evaluation_points": [
        "Application Layer",
        "DNS (Domain Name System) operates at the Application Layer"

    },
    "answer": "The **Application Layer** (Layer 7) is primarily responsible for translating the human-readable domain name (like Google.com) into an IP address using **DNS** (Domain Name System).\n",
    "evaluation": {
      "score": 10,
      "feedback": "The answer is accurate, complete, and clearly explains the role of the Application Layer and DNS in translating a domain name to an IP address. It correctly identifies the Application Layer (Layer 7) as the layer where DNS operates, enabling the translation process necessary for accessing websites.",
      "strengths": [
        "Technical accuracy: The answer correctly identifies the Application Layer and DNS.",
        "Completeness: The answer provides the necessary information to answer the question fully.",
        "Clarity: The explanation is easy to understand and concise."

      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "To further demonstrate understanding, you could briefly describe how the DNS query process works (e.g., recursive vs. iterative queries).",
        "You could also mention how DNS caching contributes to faster website access."
