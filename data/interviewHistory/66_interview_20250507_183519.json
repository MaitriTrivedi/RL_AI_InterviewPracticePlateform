      "difficulty": 5.9991862789965475,
      "content": "Imagine you are designing a real-time operating system (RTOS) for a low-power embedded device controlling a robotic arm. This RTOS uses a preemptive priority-based scheduling algorithm with context switching. The robotic arm's control software consists of multiple tasks, including:\n\n*   **Task A (High Priority):** Processes sensor data and makes immediate adjustments to the arm's motor positions to maintain stability. Any interruption to this task can lead to instability.\n*   **Task B (Medium Priority):** Handles communication with a remote server, sending telemetry data and receiving new instructions. This task can tolerate brief interruptions.\n*   **Task C (Low Priority):** Performs long-running calculations to optimize the arm's trajectory based on historical data. This task is less time-sensitive.\n\nTask B utilizes a mutex to protect access to a shared network resource. During a context switch, a situation arises where Task B is holding the mutex when Task A becomes ready and preempts it.  This could lead to priority inversion. \n\nDescribe how you would mitigate the priority inversion problem in this context-switching scenario to ensure the stability of the robotic arm? Explain the chosen technique's advantages and disadvantages, specifically considering the resource constraints (memory and processing power) of the embedded device.",

      "feedback": "The answer \"don't know the answer\" demonstrates no understanding of the priority inversion problem, mitigation techniques, or the trade-offs involved. It fails to address any aspect of the question, showing a lack of knowledge regarding RTOS principles and embedded system design considerations. The response provides no information on priority inheritance, priority ceiling protocols, or how to apply these techniques in a resource-constrained environment. Therefore, it warrants a score of 0.",
