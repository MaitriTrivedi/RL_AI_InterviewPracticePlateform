Initially, the database has a single table called `Books` with the following columns: `BookID`, `Title`, `AuthorName`, `AuthorNationality`, `PublisherName`, `PublisherAddress`, `ISBN`, `Price`. This table suffers from redundancy and several anomalies (update, insertion, and deletion). Describe a normalization strategy to decompose this table into a set of tables that are in at least 3NF. Explain your reasoning for each step, specifically addressing how you are resolving the redundancy and potential anomalies. Also, provide SQL code snippets to create the resulting tables, including primary and foreign key constraints.",

    "answer": "### Normalization Strategy:\n\nTo remove redundancy and anomalies, we will decompose the `Books` table into multiple tables following **3NF** (Third Normal Form). We'll follow these steps:\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: **1NF (First Normal Form)**\n\n1NF requires that each column contain atomic (indivisible) values, and each record must be unique.\n\n* The `Books` table already satisfies 1NF because each column has atomic values and each row is unique.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: **2NF (Second Normal Form)**\n\n2NF eliminates partial dependency, where non-key attributes depend on part of a composite primary key.\n\n* In the `Books` table, the `AuthorName`, `AuthorNationality`, `PublisherName`, and `PublisherAddress` are dependent on the `BookID` (primary key), but not fully on a composite key.\n* Therefore, we need to separate `Authors` and `Publishers` into their own tables.\n\n#### New tables after 2NF:\n\n1. `Books` - Contains only book-specific details.\n2. `Authors` - Contains author details.\n3. `Publishers` - Contains publisher details.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: **3NF (Third Normal Form)**\n\n3NF removes transitive dependencies, where non-key attributes depend on other non-key attributes.\n\n* `AuthorName` and `AuthorNationality` depend on the `AuthorID`, not directly on `BookID`.\n* Similarly, `PublisherName` and `PublisherAddress` depend on `PublisherID`, not directly on `BookID`.\n\n---\n\n### Resulting Tables:\n\n#### 1. **Authors Table**:\n\nContains author details.\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE Authors (\n    AuthorID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    AuthorName VARCHAR(255),\n    AuthorNationality VARCHAR(100)\n);\n```\n\n#### 2. **Publishers Table**:\n\nContains publisher details.\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE Publishers (\n    PublisherID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    PublisherName VARCHAR(255),\n    PublisherAddress VARCHAR(255)\n);\n```\n\n#### 3. **Books Table**:\n\nContains book-specific details and references `Authors` and `Publishers` via foreign keys.\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE Books (\n    BookID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    Title VARCHAR(255),\n    ISBN VARCHAR(20),\n    Price DECIMAL(10, 2),\n    AuthorID INT,\n    PublisherID INT,\n    FOREIGN KEY (AuthorID) REFERENCES Authors(AuthorID),\n    FOREIGN KEY (PublisherID) REFERENCES Publishers(PublisherID)\n);\n```\n\n---\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Redundancy**: Removed redundancy by separating authors and publishers into their own tables.\n2. **Update Anomalies**: If an author's name or nationality changes, it needs to be updated only in the `Authors` table, not in every book record.\n3. **Insertion Anomalies**: New authors or publishers can be added without having to add duplicate information in the `Books` table.\n4. **Deletion Anomalies**: If a book is deleted, author and publisher information is not lost (because they are in separate tables).\n\nBy decomposing the `Books` table, we have achieved **3NF**, minimizing redundancy and eliminating update, insertion, and deletion anomalies.\n",

      "feedback": "The answer provides a good explanation of database normalization up to 3NF and correctly identifies the redundancy and anomalies in the original table. The decomposition into Authors, Publishers, and Books tables is accurate, and the SQL code is generally correct, including the primary and foreign key constraints. The explanation of how the normalization addresses update, insertion, and deletion anomalies is also well done. However, the initial explanation of 2NF could be more precise, and the description of how each table conforms to 3NF specifically could be improved. It's assumed the original table satisfies 1NF which is correct. More explicitly stating this is good. Also, the answer does not touch on BCNF which, while not explicitly required, could have improved the answer further. More context on the initial table would have been great. (e.g. How large is it, or assumptions around the cardinality of authors/publishers etc. ).",
