      "content": "Imagine you're designing a database for a small library. You have a single table storing book information. Currently, the table includes columns like 'BookID', 'BookTitle', 'AuthorName', 'AuthorAddress', 'PublisherName', 'PublisherAddress'. You notice that Author and Publisher information is repeated for each book by the same Author or Publisher. Explain how you would apply normalization to reduce data redundancy in this design. Which normal form would you aim for initially, and why?",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "What are the advantages of normalizing your database design in this scenario?",
        "What would be the primary key(s) for the new tables you'd create?"

        "Identification of repeating groups (Author and Publisher information)",
        "Understanding of 1NF and 2NF",
        "Ability to decompose the original table into multiple related tables",
