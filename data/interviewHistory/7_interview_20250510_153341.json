Explain one basic approach you could take to ensure your website can handle this increased load without crashing or becoming significantly slower. Focus on one specific component that you might scale.",

    "answer": "One basic approach to handle the increased load of users on your website would be to **scale your web server** by implementing **horizontal scaling**. This involves adding more **web server instances** to distribute the load rather than relying on a single server to handle all incoming requests.\n\n### Why Scale the Web Server?\n\nAs your website grows from 100 to 1000 users a day, your current server may struggle to handle the increased number of concurrent connections. This could result in slow response times, timeouts, or even server crashes. By horizontally scaling the web server, you can distribute incoming requests across multiple servers, ensuring that no single server becomes overwhelmed.\n\n### How to Scale the Web Server:\n\n1. **Load Balancer**: Set up a **load balancer** in front of your web servers. The load balancer will distribute incoming traffic evenly across multiple instances of your web server. It will ensure that each server handles a portion of the load, keeping the response times consistent even as the number of users increases.\n\n2. **Auto-Scaling (Cloud-based approach)**: If you're using cloud services like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, you can implement **auto-scaling**. This allows your infrastructure to automatically add new web server instances during peak traffic times (like during user growth) and remove them when demand decreases, optimizing both performance and costs.\n\n3. **Stateless Web Servers**: Make sure your web servers are **stateless**, meaning they don\u2019t store session data locally. This ensures that any request can be handled by any server, making it easy to scale horizontally. Session data can be managed externally using a service like a **distributed cache (e.g., Redis)** or a **database**.\n\nBy scaling your web server horizontally, you increase the overall capacity of your website to handle more users without relying on a single, potentially overwhelmed server. This approach provides better fault tolerance and can improve the overall user experience as your traffic grows.\n\n",

      "score": 9,
      "feedback": "The answer is excellent. It correctly identifies horizontal scaling as a viable approach and clearly explains the rationale behind scaling the web server to handle increased user load. The steps provided (load balancer, auto-scaling, stateless web servers) are practical and relevant. The explanation is clear, concise, and demonstrates a good understanding of the concepts. The mention of using Redis or a database for session management when making servers stateless is a great point. There's a good understanding of fault tolerance and improved user experience as well.",
