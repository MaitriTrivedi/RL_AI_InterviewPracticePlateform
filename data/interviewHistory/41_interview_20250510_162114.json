      "topic": "system_design",
      "subtopic": "CAP Theorem",
      "difficulty": 4.5,
      "content": "Imagine you are designing a simple online store. You need to choose a database for storing product information (name, description, price, quantity in stock). Considering the CAP theorem, and given that showing slightly outdated inventory is acceptable during a network partition (e.g., displaying \"in stock\" when the last item was just purchased, leading to a minor oversell), which property of CAP would you prioritize? Explain your choice and give a specific example of a scenario where this prioritization is beneficial.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "What are the trade-offs of choosing this property over the others?",
        "How would your choice change if the online store also handled financial transactions (e.g., storing credit card information, processing payments)?",
        "What are some common database systems that are designed around the property you selected?"
      ],
      "evaluation_points": [
        "Understanding of CAP theorem (Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance)",
        "Recognizing the trade-offs between consistency and availability",
        "Applying CAP to a practical scenario (online store inventory)",
        "Justification for prioritizing Availability (AP) over Consistency (CP) in this context",

    "evaluation": {
      "score": 1,
      "feedback": "The candidate indicated they do not know the answer. This demonstrates a lack of fundamental knowledge related to database selection and the CAP theorem. The answer provides no insight into the trade-offs involved in database design. Therefore, the response receives a very low score.",

      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Research the CAP theorem and its implications for distributed systems.",
        "Study examples of how different databases prioritize consistency or availability (e.g., MongoDB vs. Cassandra).",
        "Practice applying the CAP theorem to different real-world scenarios involving data storage and retrieval."
