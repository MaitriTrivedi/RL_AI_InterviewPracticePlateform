      "difficulty": 4.0,
      "content": "Imagine you have two processes: a data producer that generates sensor readings (e.g., temperature, humidity) and a data consumer that logs these readings to a file. These processes are running on the same machine. Describe which Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanism would be most suitable for this scenario, justifying your choice. Consider factors like simplicity, performance, and the volume of data being transferred. Briefly explain how you would implement the chosen IPC mechanism in pseudocode or a high-level description.",

    "answer": "For this scenario, the most suitable IPC mechanism would be a **message queue** or a **pipe**. Both processes are running on the same machine, so a **pipe** offers a simple and efficient way to pass data between them. A pipe is lightweight, supports streaming data, and ensures that the producer and consumer processes are decoupled, allowing them to run independently without direct access to each other's memory. The data producer writes sensor readings to the pipe, while the consumer reads from it and logs the data.\n\n### High-level description:\n\n* **Producer**: Reads sensor data and writes it to the pipe.\n* **Consumer**: Reads data from the pipe and logs it to a file.\n\n### Pseudocode:\n\n```python\n# Producer\nimport os\nimport time\n\npipe_name = \"/tmp/sensor_pipe\"\nif not os.path.exists(pipe_name):\n    os.mkfifo(pipe_name)\n\nwith open(pipe_name, 'w') as pipe:\n    while True:\n        data = get_sensor_reading()  # Function to get sensor data\n        pipe.write(f\"{data}\\n\")\n        time.sleep(1)  # Simulating data generation interval\n\n# Consumer\nwith open(pipe_name, 'r') as pipe, open(\"sensor_log.txt\", 'a') as log_file:\n    while True:\n        data = pipe.read()\n        log_file.write(data)\n```\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the real-time transfer of data with low latency, making it ideal for this use case.\n",

      "feedback": "The answer is good and correctly identifies a pipe as a suitable IPC mechanism. The explanation justifies the choice based on simplicity and decoupling of processes. The high-level description and pseudocode are clear and demonstrate an understanding of how to implement a pipe for this use case. However, it could be improved by discussing the limitations of pipes, such as their unidirectional nature and potential blocking behavior. Also, while message queues were mentioned as an alternative, the response could benefit from a more in-depth comparison of pipes versus message queues, highlighting the trade-offs of each, and why pipes were ultimately chosen for this specific scenario.",
      "strengths": [
        "Correctly identifies pipe as a suitable IPC mechanism.",
        "Provides clear and concise explanation.",
        "Includes functional pseudocode that demonstrates understanding.",
        "Highlights decoupling benefit of pipes."

      "areas_for_improvement": [
        "Could benefit from a more in-depth comparison between pipes and message queues, justifying the final choice.",
        "The pseudocode in the consumer could be improved. `pipe.read()` will wait until the producer writes something to the pipe. If the producer stops writing, `pipe.read()` will wait indefinitely and should use some type of check to ensure the pipe hasn't closed. `pipe.readline()` would be more appropriate.",
        "Discuss limitations of pipes, such as unidirectional communication and blocking nature."
      ],
      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Explain how you would handle errors or exceptions in the producer and consumer processes.",
        "How would you modify your solution to handle multiple producers sending data to a single consumer?",
        "Compare and contrast pipes with message queues, specifically highlighting scenarios where message queues might be a better choice."
