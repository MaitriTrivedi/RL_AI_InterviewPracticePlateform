      "content": "Imagine you're building a system to represent different types of vehicles. You have a base `Vehicle` class with properties like `color` and `engine_type`. You now need to create `Car` and `Bicycle` classes. Explain how inheritance can be used to avoid code duplication and what properties `Car` and `Bicycle` might inherit from `Vehicle`.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "What keyword is typically used to establish an inheritance relationship between classes in common programming languages like Java, Python, or C++?",

    "answer": "In object-oriented programming (OOP), inheritance allows you to create a new class based on an existing class, inheriting its properties and methods. This helps to avoid code duplication by enabling shared functionality between classes.\n\nInheritance in this Context:\nYou have a base class called Vehicle, which contains common properties like color and engine_type. Then, you need to create specific classes like Car and Bicycle that have their own unique properties but also share some characteristics with all vehicles.\n\nHow Inheritance Avoids Code Duplication:\nBy using inheritance, both the Car and Bicycle classes can inherit the properties and methods from the Vehicle class, so you don\u2019t have to redefine the same attributes (like color and engine_type) in both the Car and Bicycle classes. This promotes code reuse and reduces redundancy.\n\nInheritance Structure:\nVehicle Class (Base Class):\n\nThis class defines the properties and methods that are common to all vehicles, like color and engine_type.\n\nCar and Bicycle Classes (Derived Classes):\n\nThese classes inherit from the Vehicle class and add their own specific properties (such as number_of_doors for Car and has_gears for Bicycle), but they automatically get the common properties (color, engine_type) from the Vehicle class.\n",

      "feedback": "The answer provides a solid explanation of inheritance and its benefits in the context of the vehicle example. It correctly identifies the base and derived classes and explains how code duplication is avoided. However, it could be improved by elaborating on scenarios where the inherited properties might need to be overridden or modified in the derived classes to suit specific needs. For instance, `engine_type` might not be applicable to a Bicycle, and the answer doesn't delve into handling such exceptions or providing alternatives like a default value, interface implementation or a 'null engine' object. Additionally, the explanation of 'is-a' relationship could be more explicit.",

        "Clear explanation of inheritance concepts.",

        "Lack of discussion on overriding inherited properties when necessary.",
        "Missed opportunity to explicitly discuss the 'is-a' relationship (Car 'is-a' Vehicle, Bicycle 'is-a' Vehicle).",
        "Could benefit from mentioning alternative design approaches if the Engine is not applicable (e.g. abstract classes and Interfaces)."
      ],
      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Explain how you would handle a scenario where a derived class doesn't need or use all the properties inherited from the base class. Consider the `engine_type` property in the `Bicycle` class.",
        "Describe the 'is-a' relationship in more detail and explain why inheritance is appropriate in this scenario. Give another example where inheritance may be unsuitable or not ideal, forcing the need for composition.",
        "Can you provide code examples to illustrate the concepts you've explained?"
