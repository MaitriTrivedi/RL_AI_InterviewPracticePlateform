    "answer": "### Problem Overview:\n\nIn a multithreaded web server scenario, multiple clients can send requests concurrently. Each request increases a shared counter (representing the number of requests served). Without proper synchronization, multiple threads accessing and updating this counter simultaneously can cause **race conditions**, leading to incorrect results. The goal is to ensure that updates to the counter are thread-safe.\n\n### Solution Approach:\n\nTo ensure thread safety when accessing and updating the shared counter, we can use synchronization mechanisms such as **mutexes** (mutual exclusion locks) or **atomic operations**. In this case, a **mutex** can be used to lock the critical section (the part of the code that updates the counter) so that only one thread at a time can modify the shared counter.\n\n### Using a Mutex for Synchronization:\n\n1. **Mutex (Lock)**: We use a mutex to ensure that when one thread updates the counter, no other thread can access or modify it until the first thread has finished.\n2. **Critical Section**: The code that updates the counter will be enclosed in a section guarded by the mutex.\n3. **Thread-safe Update**: Each thread acquires the lock, increments the counter, and then releases the lock.\n\n### Example Code (Python Using `threading` Module):\n\n```python\nimport threading\n\nclass WebServer:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.counter = 0  # Shared counter\n        self.lock = threading.Lock()  # Mutex lock\n\n    def handle_request(self):\n        # Simulating request handling\n        with self.lock:  # Critical section\n            self.counter += 1  # Safe update of shared counter\n\n    def get_request_count(self):\n        # Read the counter value safely (can also be protected with lock)\n        return self.counter\n\n# Simulating server with multiple threads\ndef simulate_client_request(server):\n    for _ in range(100):  # Each client makes 100 requests\n        server.handle_request()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    server = WebServer()\n\n    # Create multiple threads to simulate multiple clients\n    threads = []\n    for _ in range(10):  # Simulate 10 clients\n        thread = threading.Thread(target=simulate_client_request, args=(server,))\n        threads.append(thread)\n        thread.start()\n\n    # Wait for all threads to complete\n    for thread in threads:\n        thread.join()\n\n    print(f\"Total requests handled: {server.get_request_count()}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n\n1. **WebServer Class**:\n\n   * The `WebServer` class has a shared counter (`self.counter`) and a lock (`self.lock`) to protect this counter from concurrent updates.\n   * The `handle_request()` method simulates handling a request by incrementing the counter. It does so in a **critical section**, which is protected by a mutex (`self.lock`).\n   * The `get_request_count()` method allows reading the current counter value.\n\n2. **Simulating Client Requests**:\n\n   * The `simulate_client_request()` function simulates a client making multiple requests to the server.\n   * Multiple threads are created to simulate different clients, each making 100 requests.\n\n3. **Thread Management**:\n\n   * Threads are started and then joined to wait for all client requests to be handled before printing the final count.\n\n### Synchronization Mechanism (Mutex):\n\n* **Locking**: When `handle_request()` is called, the `with self.lock` statement ensures that only one thread can enter the critical section at a time. If a thread is already inside the critical section, any other thread attempting to enter will be blocked until the lock is released.\n* **Thread-Safety**: This prevents **race conditions**, ensuring that the counter is updated correctly.\n\n### Time Complexity:\n\n* **Per Request**: Each request involves acquiring and releasing the lock, which is O(1) time for each operation.\n* **Overall Complexity**: If there are `n` requests handled by `m` threads, the time complexity is O(n), assuming thread creation and management overhead is minimal.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBy using a **mutex**, we ensure that the counter is updated safely without race conditions. This approach guarantees the integrity of the shared data while allowing concurrent processing of client requests in a multithreaded environment.\n\n",

      "feedback": "The answer provides a solid understanding of how to use mutexes to protect a shared counter in a multithreaded web server scenario. The explanation of race conditions and the use of a mutex is clear and accurate. The Python code provides a working example, although the `get_request_count` method could also benefit from being protected by the lock to prevent reading a potentially inconsistent value. The time complexity analysis is somewhat simplistic but acceptable. A stronger answer would consider alternatives to mutexes, such as atomic operations, and discuss the trade-offs.",
