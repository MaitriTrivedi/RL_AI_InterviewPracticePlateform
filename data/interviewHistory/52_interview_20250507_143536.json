      "difficulty": 8.944390641895254,
      "content": "You are designing a real-time analytics dashboard for a rapidly growing IoT platform that collects sensor data from millions of devices globally. The data includes timestamps, device IDs, sensor readings (temperature, pressure, humidity), and location coordinates. You've chosen a distributed NoSQL database (e.g., Cassandra, DynamoDB, or similar) to handle the high ingest rate and scalability requirements. Explain your strategy for data modeling, considering the following specific analytical queries that the dashboard needs to support:\n\n1.  Aggregated average temperature for a given geographic region (e.g., city, country) over a sliding time window (e.g., past hour, past day).\n2.  Top N devices with the highest pressure readings in the last X minutes, globally.\n3.  Number of devices reporting abnormal readings (defined as temperature exceeding a threshold) per geographic region, displayed on a map, updated every minute.\n4. Alerting when the rate of devices reporting abnormal readings in a specific region exceeds a certain threshold over a short period of time (e.g. 5 minutes)",
