      "topic": null,
      "subtopic": "CPU Scheduling",
      "difficulty": 3.0,
      "content": "Imagine you have three tasks running on a CPU: Task A, Task B, and Task C. Task A requires 10 units of CPU time, Task B requires 5 units, and Task C requires 2 units. If you were to use First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) scheduling, and the tasks arrive in the order A, B, then C, what is the average waiting time for each task before they start execution?",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "What is a potential disadvantage of using FCFS scheduling?",
        "Can you think of a situation where FCFS would be a suitable scheduling algorithm?"

        "Calculating the waiting time for each task (A=0, B=10, C=15)",

    "answer": "don't know the answer",

      "score": 1,
      "feedback": "The candidate stated that they do not know the answer. This demonstrates a lack of knowledge regarding basic CPU scheduling algorithms, specifically First-Come, First-Served (FCFS). The expected answer would have included calculating the waiting time for each task (A=0, B=10, C=15) and then calculating the average waiting time ((0+10+15)/3 = 8.33).",
      "strengths": [],
      "areas_for_improvement": [

        "Study basic CPU scheduling algorithms, including FCFS, Shortest Job First (SJF), Priority Scheduling, and Round Robin.",
        "Practice calculating waiting time, turnaround time, and throughput for each algorithm using different arrival times and burst times."
