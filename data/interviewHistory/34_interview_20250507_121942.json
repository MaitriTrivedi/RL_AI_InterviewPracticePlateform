      "content": "You are tasked with designing a rate limiter for an API gateway that handles a high volume of requests. This rate limiter needs to handle requests from different clients with varying Service Level Agreements (SLAs). Each client is assigned a priority level (1-10, 1 being the highest priority) and a token bucket capacity representing their allocated requests per minute. Higher priority clients should be served first, and when multiple clients of the same priority are waiting, the one whose token bucket is closest to being full should be served first. Design a concurrent data structure and algorithm to efficiently manage and process these requests. The system needs to handle millions of requests per minute with minimal latency. Furthermore, implement a mechanism to gracefully handle situations where a client exceeds their allocated rate limit, ensuring no starvation for lower-priority clients. Explain the time complexity for enqueueing, dequeuing, and updating client token buckets. Consider thread safety, deadlock avoidance, and minimizing contention in your design.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "How would you handle persistent storage of token bucket data to survive server restarts?",
        "How can you dynamically adjust the token bucket capacity of a client based on real-time system load?",
        "What are potential security vulnerabilities in your rate limiter design, and how would you address them?"

      "feedback": "The candidate responded with \"don't know\", indicating a complete lack of understanding or preparation for the question. The question involved designing a concurrent rate limiter, a common and crucial component in high-volume API gateways. A strong answer would have detailed a data structure like a concurrent priority queue, token bucket management, thread-safe operations, rate-limiting strategies, and time complexity analysis. The absence of any attempt to address the prompt demonstrates a significant gap in knowledge.",
