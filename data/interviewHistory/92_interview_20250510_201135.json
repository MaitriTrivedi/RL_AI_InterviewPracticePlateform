      "content": "You are given a nested directory structure represented as a dictionary. Each key in the dictionary is a directory name, and its value is either another dictionary (representing a subdirectory) or a list of files in that directory.  Implement a recursive function `count_files(directory)` that takes this directory dictionary as input and returns the total number of files in all directories and subdirectories. Assume the lists contain only string file names and dictionaries only contains directory names. For example:\n\n```python\ndirectory = {\n    'root': {\n        'dir1': ['file1.txt', 'file2.txt'],\n        'dir2': {\n            'subdir1': ['file3.txt']\n        },\n        'dir3': []\n    }\n}\n\nprint(count_files(directory))\n```\nThis should print 3.",

      "feedback": "The code is correct, efficient, and addresses the problem completely. It correctly handles the base case (list of files) and the recursive step (subdirectory). The use of `isinstance` is appropriate and clear. The example usage is also included and produces the correct output. The code is well-structured and easy to understand.",
