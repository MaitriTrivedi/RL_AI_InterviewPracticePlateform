    "answer": "A **file system** is a method and data structure that an operating system uses to manage and organize data on storage devices like hard drives, SSDs, or USBs. It provides a way to store, retrieve, name, and organize files and directories in a structured and efficient manner. File systems also handle metadata (such as file creation date, size, and permissions) and manage how space is allocated on the disk.\n\nThe primary problem a file system solves is the **efficient and reliable organization and retrieval of data**. Without a file system, data would be stored in an unstructured mass of bits, making it nearly impossible to locate, manage, or prevent corruption of individual files. By imposing structure, it allows users and applications to find and use files easily, supports multitasking and data security, and ensures that different programs don\u2019t overwrite each other's data.\n",

      "feedback": "This is a very strong answer that accurately explains the core concepts of a file system. It clearly articulates the role of a file system in organizing data, providing an abstraction over raw storage, managing metadata, and addressing the problem of unstructured data storage. The explanation of the file system's role in enabling efficient retrieval, multitasking, and data security is excellent. The answer demonstrates a good understanding of the purpose and functionality of file systems. Minor improvements could be made by adding a brief mention of different types of file systems or going into further detail about space allocation strategies (e.g., contiguous, linked, indexed).",
