      "topic": "algo",
      "subtopic": "Divide and Conquer",
      "difficulty": 5.0,
      "content": "You're tasked with processing a large log file (100GB+) containing website access records. Each line represents a record and includes the IP address of the client. Your goal is to find the top 10 most frequent IP addresses in the log file efficiently. Describe how you could use a Divide and Conquer approach to solve this problem. You don't need to write code, but clearly explain the steps involved, including how you would divide the problem, conquer each subproblem, and combine the results. Consider memory constraints and practical limitations when dealing with such a large file.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "What data structure would you use to store the IP address counts in each subproblem, and why?",
        "How would you handle the situation where the same IP address appears in multiple subproblems during the merging phase?",
        "What are the potential limitations of this approach, and how could you mitigate them?"
      ],
      "evaluation_points": [
        "Dividing the log file into smaller, manageable chunks",
        "Counting IP addresses within each chunk independently",
        "Merging the results from each chunk efficiently (e.g., using a heap or a sorted list)",
        "Considering memory limitations and avoiding loading the entire file into memory"

      "feedback": "The candidate stated that they do not know how to approach the problem. This indicates a lack of understanding of Divide and Conquer strategies and their applicability to large data processing tasks. The response doesn't demonstrate any understanding of memory constraints, efficient data structures (e.g., heaps), or file processing techniques relevant to the problem.",

      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Study the Divide and Conquer paradigm with examples like Merge Sort and Quick Sort.",
        "Research how to process large files in chunks to avoid memory overflow.",
        "Learn about the use of hash maps for counting frequencies and heaps for maintaining top-k elements.",
        "Practice applying these concepts to similar problems involving data aggregation from large datasets."
