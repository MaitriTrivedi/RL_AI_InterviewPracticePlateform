      "difficulty": 5.994652912924228,
      "content": "You are building a web application that serves both static assets (images, CSS, JavaScript) and dynamic content. To improve performance, you decide to implement browser caching for static assets. Describe a strategy, including specific HTTP headers and their values, to effectively cache static assets for one month (approximately 30 days) while ensuring that dynamic content is never cached. Explain why your chosen strategy works and how you would verify that the caching is working as expected from the client-side. Furthermore, discuss a scenario where this strategy might cause issues for static assets if a bug fix is deployed in one of these assets, and how you would mitigate the issue in a real-world deployment.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "How would you handle cache invalidation for specific assets if a bug fix needs to be deployed before the cache expires?",
        "What are the potential downsides of aggressive caching, and how can you balance caching performance with the need for fresh content?"
