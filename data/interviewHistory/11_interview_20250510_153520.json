      "difficulty": 3.5,
      "content": "Imagine you are building a system to process payments. You need to support different payment gateways like Stripe and PayPal. Using abstraction, how would you design your system so that adding a new payment gateway in the future requires minimal code changes? Specifically, define an abstract class or interface and describe how Stripe and PayPal would implement it.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "What are the benefits of using abstraction in this scenario?",
        "How would you handle payment-specific details (e.g., Stripe's charges vs. PayPal's fees) while maintaining the abstraction?"
      ],
      "evaluation_points": [
        "Identification of the need for an abstract PaymentGateway class/interface.",
        "Clear implementation of Stripe/PayPal as concrete classes implementing the abstract PaymentGateway, overriding abstract methods.",
        "Demonstration of understanding that the core payment processing logic remains consistent regardless of the underlying gateway.",
        "Basic understanding of method overriding."

      "feedback": "The answer 'afasc' demonstrates no understanding of the problem, object-oriented programming principles, or the concept of abstraction. It doesn't address any of the requirements outlined in the question. There is no attempt to define an abstract class/interface, implement concrete classes for Stripe and PayPal, or explain how the core payment processing logic would remain consistent. It is essentially a null response.",

        "Review the concepts of abstraction, interfaces, and abstract classes in object-oriented programming.",
