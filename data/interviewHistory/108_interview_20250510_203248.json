      "content": "Imagine you're building a system to manage different types of notifications (e.g., email, SMS, push notifications). You have a class `NotificationSender` with methods like `sendEmail(recipient, message)` and `sendSMS(phoneNumber, message)`.  How could you use abstraction to make this code more flexible and easier to maintain if you anticipate adding more notification types in the future?",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "Can you provide a simple code example demonstrating your solution (using pseudocode or your preferred language)?",
        "What are the benefits of using abstraction in this scenario, compared to directly adding more `sendXXX` methods to the `NotificationSender` class?"
      ],
      "evaluation_points": [
        "Identification of common interface or abstract class.",
        "Ability to describe how the abstract class/interface decouples the notification system from specific notification methods."

      "feedback": "The candidate stated they do not know the answer. This indicates a lack of understanding of basic abstraction principles, which are fundamental to object-oriented design and software maintainability. The question explores a common design problem of decoupling code from concrete implementations. A solid understanding of interfaces or abstract classes is essential to answer this question successfully.",

      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Review the concepts of abstraction, interfaces, and abstract classes in object-oriented programming. Focus on understanding how they can be used to decouple code.",
        "Practice implementing similar scenarios involving different types of services or components using interfaces or abstract classes to promote flexibility and maintainability.",
        "Explore design patterns such as the Strategy pattern, which heavily relies on abstraction for selecting different algorithms or behaviors at runtime."
