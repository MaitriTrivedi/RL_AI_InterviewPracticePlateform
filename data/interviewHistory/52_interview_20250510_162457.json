    "answer": "To solve the problem of determining the minimum number of coins needed to make exact change for a given amount using a **greedy approach**, we'll use the largest coin denominations first and work our way down. This ensures that at each step, we're using the fewest coins possible to reach the required amount.\n\n### Approach:\n\n1. **Coin Denominations**: The available denominations are `[100, 25, 10, 5, 1]` (cents). The greedy approach works by always choosing the largest denomination that is less than or equal to the remaining amount of money.\n\n2. **Greedy Choice**: Start with the largest coin (100 cents) and see how many times it can be used. Subtract the equivalent value from the amount and continue with the next largest coin, and so on, until the amount is zero.\n\n3. **Implementation**:\n\n   * Initialize a counter for the number of coins used.\n   * For each coin in the denominations, use as many of that coin as possible (i.e., perform integer division) and subtract the corresponding value from `amountDue`.\n   * Repeat this for all the coin denominations until the amount is reduced to zero.\n\n### Python Code Implementation:\n\n```python\ndef min_coins(amountDue):\n    # List of coin denominations in descending order\n    coins = [100, 25, 10, 5, 1]\n    # Initialize the number of coins to 0\n    num_coins = 0\n    \n    # Process each coin starting from the largest denomination\n    for coin in coins:\n        # Use as many of this coin as possible\n        num_coins += amountDue // coin\n        # Reduce the amount by the total value of coins used\n        amountDue %= coin\n    \n    return num_coins\n\n# Example Usage\nprint(min_coins(273))  # Output: 6 (2 coins of 100, 1 coin of 50, 1 coin of 25, 1 coin of 10, 1 coin of 5)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Greedy Algorithm**:\n\n   * We start with the largest coin (100 cents) and see how many times it can fit into the `amountDue`. For example, if the `amountDue` is 273, we can use 2 coins of 100 cents.\n   * Then, subtract the total value of those coins from the `amountDue` (273 - 200 = 73).\n   * We then repeat the process for the next largest coin (25 cents), and continue until the `amountDue` becomes 0.\n\n2. **Time Complexity**:\n\n   * The time complexity of this solution is **O(1)** because we are iterating over a fixed number of coin denominations (5 denominations in this case), and each step involves simple arithmetic operations (division and modulus).\n\n3. **Why Greedy Works Here**:\n\n   * This problem works well with a greedy approach because the coin denominations are structured in a way that taking the largest coin first is always optimal. This ensures that we minimize the number of coins used at each step.\n\n### Example Walkthrough:\n\nFor `amountDue = 273`:\n\n* Start with the 100-cent coin: `273 // 100 = 2` (so we use 2 coins of 100, subtract 200 from 273 \u2192 `273 - 200 = 73`).\n* Next, the 25-cent coin: `73 // 25 = 2` (use 2 coins of 25, subtract 50 from 73 \u2192 `73 - 50 = 23`).\n* Then, the 10-cent coin: `23 // 10 = 2` (use 2 coins of 10, subtract 20 from 23 \u2192 `23 - 20 = 3`).\n* The 5-cent coin: `3 // 5 = 0` (cannot use any 5-cent coins, so skip this).\n* Finally, the 1-cent coin: `3 // 1 = 3` (use 3 coins of 1).\n\nThus, the total number of coins used is **6**.\n",

      "feedback": "The answer is excellent. The student correctly implements the greedy algorithm for the coin change problem and provides a clear explanation of the approach. The code is well-written, efficient, and easy to understand. The time complexity analysis is also accurate. The example walkthrough helps solidify the understanding of the algorithm's execution. A minor improvement could be made by including a brief discussion of cases where the greedy approach *doesn't* work optimally (for non-canonical coin systems), even though it is not explicitly asked for, demonstrating further depth of knowledge.",
