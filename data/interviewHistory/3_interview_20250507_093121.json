    "answer": "Caching is the process of storing copies of frequently accessed data in a temporary storage location, known as a cache, to improve the speed and efficiency of future data retrieval. Instead of fetching the same data from a database or server every time a request is made, the cached version of the data is used, reducing the time it takes to retrieve it. This is particularly beneficial for websites that handle a large volume of traffic or data that doesn't change frequently, as it reduces server load and decreases response times.\n\nIn the context of a website displaying frequently accessed product information, caching could significantly improve performance by storing copies of product details that users commonly request. For example, if a product page displays information such as the product name, price, description, and image, this information can be cached after the first request. When another user accesses the same product page, the cached version of this information is served instead of fetching it again from the database or backend, which can be slower.\n\nA specific example of what product information you might cache includes **product details** such as the name, price, and stock availability of popular products. For instance, a popular smartphone model's details might be accessed frequently by users. By caching these details, the website can serve the product's data much faster, leading to a quicker browsing experience for users. Additionally, caching can reduce the load on your backend systems, which allows resources to be allocated more efficiently, especially during high traffic periods.\n",

      "score": 8,
      "feedback": "The answer provides a good explanation of caching and its benefits for a website displaying product information. The explanation is clear and provides a specific example of what to cache (product details). The response touches upon the reduction of server load and improved response times. However, it lacks discussion about cache invalidation strategies and the potential for stale data. Mentioning different cache levels (e.g., browser, CDN, server-side) would also enhance the response.",
