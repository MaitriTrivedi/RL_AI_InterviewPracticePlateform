      "subtopic": "Dynamic Programming",
      "difficulty": 1.4356565352872193,
      "content": "You are helping a cashier at a small store. A customer needs to pay 17 dollars. The cashier has unlimited quantities of 1 dollar, 5 dollar, and 10 dollar bills. What is the minimum number of bills the cashier can use to give the customer the 17 dollars change? Briefly explain your approach.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "Can you explain how you would generally approach a problem that asks for the 'minimum' or 'maximum' of something, and how dynamic programming could be helpful?",
        "Without writing code, can you outline the steps you would take to solve this problem using dynamic programming principles (like defining the state and recurrence relation)?"
      ],
      "evaluation_points": [
        "Understanding the problem requires finding the minimum number of bills to reach the target amount.",
        "A greedy approach (always choosing the largest denomination) may not always lead to the optimal solution, suggesting a need for a dynamic programming-based approach for more complex problems.",
        "Explanation should mention trying different combinations of bills or building up a solution from smaller subproblems (even if a DP matrix isn't explicitly defined)."
      ],
      "expected_time_minutes": 5
    },
    "answer": "To minimize the number of bills, the cashier should prioritize using the largest denominations first. Starting with the 10-dollar bill, the cashier can give one 10-dollar bill, leaving 7 dollars. Next, they can give one 5-dollar bill, leaving 2 dollars. Finally, they can give two 1-dollar bills to make up the remaining amount. In total, the cashier uses 1 ten-dollar bill, 1 five-dollar bill, and 2 one-dollar bills, for a total of 4 bills. This is the minimum number of bills needed to make 17 dollars.\n",
    "evaluation": {
      "score": 9,
      "feedback": "The answer is correct and provides a clear explanation of the greedy approach used to solve the problem. The cashier correctly identifies the optimal combination of bills (one 10-dollar bill, one 5-dollar bill, and two 1-dollar bills). The explanation is easy to follow and demonstrates a good understanding of the problem. However, it would have been even better to explicitly state why a greedy approach works in this specific case, and to acknowledge that it doesn't always guarantee the optimal solution for all denomination combinations.",
      "strengths": [
        "Correctly identifies the optimal solution.",
        "Provides a clear and concise explanation.",
        "Demonstrates understanding of the problem's constraints."
      ],
      "areas_for_improvement": [
        "Could explicitly mention the limitations of the greedy approach in more complex scenarios.",
        "Could briefly touch upon alternative approaches like dynamic programming, even though it's not strictly necessary for this specific problem."
      ],
      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Consider how the solution would change if a 2-dollar bill was available.",
        "How would you approach the problem if the cashier had a limited number of each bill denomination?"
