      "content": "You are building a URL shortener service (like bit.ly). Describe how you would use hashing to generate short, unique identifiers for the original URLs. Focus on minimizing collisions and ensuring efficient retrieval.  Specifically, address the following:\n\n1.  What hashing algorithm would you choose and why? Consider factors like collision resistance and speed.\n2. How would you handle collisions if they occur? Explain at least two different collision resolution strategies and their trade-offs in this scenario.\n3. How would you map the hash value to a short, URL-safe string (e.g., using base62 encoding)? Briefly explain the encoding process.  Assume you need to support a large volume of URLs.",

    "answer": "1. **Hashing Algorithm**: I would choose **SHA-256** for generating hashes. It's secure, widely used, and provides a good balance of speed and collision resistance. While it's longer than necessary for a URL shortener, it reduces the likelihood of collisions, which is critical for uniqueness. For efficiency, we would only use a truncated version (e.g., first 8-10 characters) to generate the short URL.\n\n2. **Collision Handling**:\n\n   * **Rehashing**: If a collision occurs (i.e., the generated hash already exists in the database), you can rehash the original URL with a different salt or by applying a different hash function until a unique value is found. However, this can add some overhead.\n   * **Incrementing Counter**: Another option is to append a counter (e.g., starting from 1) to the original URL and rehash until a unique hash is generated. This is simpler but could result in additional storage overhead if many collisions occur.\n\n3. **Base62 Encoding**: To convert the hash to a short URL-safe string, I would use **Base62 encoding** (using characters `[A-Za-z0-9]`), which allows compact representation of the hash. For example, SHA-256\u2019s truncated hash is first converted to a number, and then Base62 encoding is applied to map that number into a URL-safe string. This ensures efficient storage and makes the URL short and readable.\n",

      "feedback": "The answer provides a reasonable approach to building a URL shortener. The choice of SHA-256, while somewhat overkill, is justified with the rationale of collision resistance. The explanation of base62 encoding is accurate. However, the collision resolution strategies provided are not ideal and there's a lack of clarity regarding database interactions and scalability. The answer also misses some nuances concerning the trade-offs in hash length and collision probability.",

      "areas_for_improvement": [
        "Collision resolution strategies are not optimal. Rehashing with a salt is inefficient and can lead to infinite loops if not implemented carefully. Incrementing a counter and rehashing has similar problems.",
        "The explanation could be more detailed regarding the database interaction. How is the existing shortened URL verified and stored?",
        "The answer does not explore alternative hash functions that may be faster while providing sufficient collision resistance, such as MurmurHash or even simpler variants.",
        "The response doesn't discuss how to handle extremely high volumes of URLs and the potential need for distributed architecture or sharding."
