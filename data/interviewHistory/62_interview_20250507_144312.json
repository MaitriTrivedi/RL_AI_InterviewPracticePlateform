      "difficulty": 10.0,
      "content": "Consider a globally distributed e-commerce platform handling millions of transactions per second.  You are responsible for designing the order processing system.  This system involves multiple microservices: `InventoryService`, `PaymentService`, `ShippingService`, and `OrderService`.  Each service resides in a different geographical region (e.g., US East, Europe West, Asia East) to minimize latency for regional users. A single order might involve inventory checks in one region, payment processing in another, and shipping originating from a third.  Due to the scale and global distribution, traditional ACID transactions are impractical due to performance limitations imposed by two-phase commit across vast distances and potential single points of failure. Propose a robust and scalable solution to ensure eventual consistency and data integrity across these services when processing an order.  Specifically, detail the transaction management strategy, including handling partial failures (e.g., PaymentService fails after InventoryService succeeds).  Explain how you would ensure idempotency, handle compensating actions, and guarantee order state visibility to the customer while maintaining a high level of availability.  Assume message queues (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) are available for asynchronous communication and eventual consistency patterns. Prioritize minimizing data loss and maximizing throughput.",

      "feedback": "The candidate stated that they do not know the answer. This demonstrates a lack of knowledge regarding distributed transaction management strategies in microservice architectures, specifically addressing eventual consistency, saga patterns, and handling failures in a distributed environment. There is no evidence of understanding key concepts like idempotency, compensating transactions, message queues, or distributed consensus.",
