      "content": "Imagine you have a social network where users are represented as nodes and friendships are represented as edges.  Explain how Breadth-First Search (BFS) could be used to find all users who are within two degrees of separation (friends of friends) from a given user.  Specifically, describe the steps involved in performing BFS starting from the given user, and how you would track the 'degree of separation'.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "What data structure would you use to implement the queue for BFS and why?",
        "What is the worst-case time complexity of this BFS operation in terms of the number of users and friendships?"

      "feedback": "The provided answer 'avfaxaxas' demonstrates no understanding of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm or its application in finding users within a certain degree of separation in a social network. The answer is nonsensical and provides no relevant information about the steps involved in BFS, the use of a queue, or how to track the degree of separation. It completely fails to address the question.",
