      "subtopic": "Stored Procedures",
      "difficulty": 5.140033117898833,
      "content": "A high-volume e-commerce site uses a stored procedure `UpdateInventory` to decrement the `Quantity` field in the `Products` table whenever an order is placed. The stored procedure takes `@ProductID` and `@QuantityOrdered` as input parameters. Due to a recent increase in traffic, you've noticed occasional deadlocks occurring when multiple users simultaneously attempt to purchase the same product.  Provide a modified version of the stored procedure incorporating a transaction and appropriate locking strategy to minimize deadlocks. Assume you are using a database system that supports explicit transaction management and row-level locking. Explain the reasoning behind your chosen locking strategy.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "How would you monitor for deadlocks in a production environment and analyze the causes?",
        "Are there alternative strategies to prevent deadlocks in this scenario, beyond explicit locking (e.g., application-level retries, optimistic locking)? Explain the trade-offs."
      ],
      "evaluation_points": [
        "Transaction management using BEGIN TRANSACTION, COMMIT TRANSACTION, and ROLLBACK TRANSACTION.",
        "Appropriate locking strategy (e.g., `WITH (UPDLOCK, HOLDLOCK)`). UPDLOCK obtains an update lock to prevent common forms of blocking. HOLDLOCK converts the update lock to an exclusive lock for the duration of the transaction.",
        "Understanding of deadlock conditions and how locking can mitigate them.",
        "Explanation of the chosen locking strategy's impact on concurrency and performance."

      "feedback": "The candidate responded with \"don't know the answer\", indicating a lack of understanding of transaction management, locking strategies in database systems, and deadlock mitigation techniques. The candidate provided no attempt to answer the question, demonstrating a significant gap in their knowledge.",

        "Understanding of database transactions and their importance in maintaining data consistency.",
        "Knowledge of different locking mechanisms (e.g., shared locks, exclusive locks, update locks) and their uses.",
        "Ability to identify deadlock conditions and implement strategies to prevent or minimize them.",
        "Familiarity with SQL syntax for transaction management (BEGIN TRANSACTION, COMMIT TRANSACTION, ROLLBACK TRANSACTION) and locking hints (e.g., UPDLOCK, HOLDLOCK).",
        "Ability to explain the trade-offs between concurrency and isolation levels in database systems.",
        "Understanding the impact of different locking strategies on performance."

      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Study database transaction management concepts, including ACID properties.",
        "Learn about different types of locks and how they are used to prevent data corruption and ensure concurrency.",
        "Practice writing SQL code that uses transactions and locking hints to solve concurrency problems.",
        "Read documentation on deadlock detection and prevention in the specific database system used by the e-commerce site (e.g., SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL).",
        "Consider taking a course or workshop on database performance tuning and optimization."
