      "content": "Imagine you're building a simple file storage service where users can upload and download files. To optimize disk usage, you want to avoid storing multiple identical copies of the same file. How would you implement a basic deduplication strategy on the file system level using file hashing?",

    "answer": "To implement a basic deduplication strategy using file hashing, I would generate a **unique hash** (e.g., using SHA-256) for each uploaded file. When a user uploads a file, the system would first compute its hash and check if that hash already exists in the database or file system. If the file's hash is already stored, it means the file is identical to one already uploaded, so the system would link to the existing file rather than storing it again. If the hash is new, the file is stored with its hash as a key, and metadata about the file (e.g., file name, user) is recorded. This approach ensures that only one copy of identical files is saved, optimizing disk usage.\n\n",

      "feedback": "The answer provides a good high-level overview of a deduplication strategy using hashing. It correctly identifies the core steps: hashing, checking for existence, and linking to existing data. However, it lacks detail in several important areas. While SHA-256 is a good choice, the answer doesn't discuss the trade-offs between different hashing algorithms (speed vs. collision resistance). It mentions storing metadata, but doesn't elaborate on where this metadata would be stored or how it would be structured in relation to the hash value. Critically, it glosses over the crucial step of collision handling. While the answer mentions linking to existing files, it does not explain *how* this linking would be implemented at the file system level (e.g., hard links, symbolic links, or a more sophisticated database-driven approach). It also fails to address the performance implications of calculating hashes on potentially large files.",
