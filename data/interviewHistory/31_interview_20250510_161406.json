      "content": "You are designing a system to ingest real-time clickstream data from a website. Currently, the website receives approximately 1,000 events per second. You anticipate that within the next year, this volume will increase to 10,000 events per second. Describe how you would scale your data ingestion pipeline to handle this anticipated increase in load. Consider both the technologies you might use and the architectural patterns you would employ to ensure scalability and reliability. Focus on horizontal scaling strategies.",

    "answer": "To handle the anticipated increase in clickstream events from 1,000 to 10,000 events per second, I would implement a distributed, **event-driven architecture** that allows for **horizontal scaling** at each component of the pipeline. The first step is to use a **distributed message queue** like **Apache Kafka** or **Amazon Kinesis**, which can handle large volumes of events in real-time. These systems allow you to scale the ingestion layer by partitioning the event stream across multiple brokers, enabling parallel processing. Horizontal scaling can be achieved by adding more partitions and increasing the number of consumers (event processors) that can independently handle different partitions of data. This decouples the event generation from the processing layer, ensuring that data can be ingested at a consistent rate without overwhelming downstream systems.\n\nOn the processing and storage side, I would use **serverless functions** (e.g., **AWS Lambda**) or containerized microservices orchestrated by **Kubernetes** to scale the event processing layer as traffic increases. These systems allow the processing capacity to elastically scale based on load, ensuring responsiveness even during peak traffic. For storage, I'd use a **distributed NoSQL database** like **Cassandra** or **Amazon DynamoDB**, which can horizontally scale to handle high-throughput writes and offer low-latency reads. This setup allows the entire pipeline to scale out as the volume of clickstream data grows, while maintaining high availability and fault tolerance.\n",

      "score": 8,
      "feedback": "The answer provides a solid overview of how to scale a clickstream data ingestion pipeline horizontally. It correctly identifies key technologies like Kafka/Kinesis, serverless functions/Kubernetes, and NoSQL databases. The explanation of partitioning and horizontal scaling is accurate. However, the response could be improved by delving deeper into specific aspects of data partitioning strategies, monitoring/alerting mechanisms, and trade-offs between different technology choices. It lacks discussion of potential bottlenecks and solutions beyond simply adding more resources.",
      "strengths": [
        "Good selection of appropriate technologies (Kafka/Kinesis, Lambda/Kubernetes, Cassandra/DynamoDB).",
        "Correctly identifies horizontal scaling as the key strategy.",
        "Demonstrates understanding of decoupling event generation from processing using message queues.",
        "Explanation of partitioning and scaling consumers is accurate."

      "areas_for_improvement": [
        "Missing detail on data partitioning strategies (e.g., key selection for partitioning, potential for data skew).",
        "Lacks a detailed discussion of monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect performance issues and bottlenecks.",
        "Doesn't address trade-offs between different technologies. For example, the trade-offs between Kafka and Kinesis, or Cassandra and DynamoDB, based on cost, operational complexity, and data consistency needs are not discussed.",
        "The answer could be expanded to include considerations for data serialization formats (e.g., Avro, Protobuf) and their impact on performance."
      ],
      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Describe different data partitioning strategies and their implications for performance and data distribution. Explain how the choice of partition key can affect system performance.",
        "Detail the monitoring and alerting mechanisms you would put in place to ensure the health and performance of the pipeline. Consider metrics such as latency, throughput, and error rates.",
        "Discuss the trade-offs between different message queue technologies (Kafka vs. Kinesis) and NoSQL databases (Cassandra vs. DynamoDB) in the context of this specific use case.",
        "Explain how you would handle schema evolution and data versioning in a real-time data stream."
