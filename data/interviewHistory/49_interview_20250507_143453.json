      "subtopic": "IP Addressing",
      "difficulty": 2.843230578780366,
      "content": "A small office network uses the IP address range 192.168.1.0/24. All devices connect to a single router which provides internet access. Explain what the '/24' signifies in this context, and how many usable IP addresses are available for devices on this network.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "What is the broadcast address for this network?",
        "Why are two IP addresses in this range usually reserved and unavailable for assigning to regular devices?"
      ],
      "evaluation_points": [
        "Understanding of CIDR notation and subnet mask",
        "Calculation of usable IP addresses (256 - 2)",
        "Knowledge of reserved addresses: network and broadcast"

      "expected_time_minutes": 5
    },
    "answer": "The **/24** in the IP range **192.168.1.0/24** indicates a subnet mask of **255.255.255.0**, meaning the first 24 bits are used for the network portion, leaving 8 bits for host addresses.\n\n* **Total IP addresses**: 2^8 = 256\n* **Usable IP addresses**: 256 - 2 (network address and broadcast address) = **254 usable IP addresses**.\n\nThese can be assigned to devices on the network.\n",
    "evaluation": {
      "score": 10,
      "feedback": "The answer is excellent and comprehensively addresses the question. It correctly explains the meaning of /24 in CIDR notation, accurately calculates the number of usable IP addresses, and clearly states the reason for subtracting 2 (network and broadcast addresses). The explanation is clear, concise, and technically accurate.",
      "strengths": [
        "Accurate explanation of CIDR notation and subnet mask.",
        "Correct calculation of total and usable IP addresses.",
        "Clear and concise explanation of reserved addresses (network and broadcast)."

      "areas_for_improvement": [],
      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Could discuss implications of running out of IP addresses in a /24 network and possible solutions like subnetting.",
        "Could briefly touch upon the role of DHCP in assigning IP addresses within this range."
