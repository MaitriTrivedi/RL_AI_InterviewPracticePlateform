      "topic": "dbms",
      "subtopic": "Joins",
      "difficulty": 3.0,
      "content": "You have two tables: `Customers` and `Orders`. The `Customers` table has columns `CustomerID` (primary key) and `CustomerName`. The `Orders` table has columns `OrderID` (primary key), `CustomerID` (foreign key referencing `Customers`), and `OrderDate`.  You need to retrieve a list of all customers and the number of orders each customer has placed.  Write a SQL query that achieves this, ensuring that even customers who haven't placed any orders are included in the result with a count of 0.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "What type of JOIN did you use and why was it the most appropriate?",
        "How would you modify the query to only show customers who have placed more than 5 orders?"
      ],
      "evaluation_points": [
        "Using a LEFT JOIN to ensure all customers are included.",
        "Using COUNT() aggregate function and GROUP BY clause."
      ],
      "expected_time_minutes": 10
    },
    "answer": "Here's the SQL query to retrieve a list of all customers along with the number of orders each customer has placed, including customers who haven't placed any orders:\n\n```sql\nSELECT c.CustomerID, c.CustomerName, COUNT(o.OrderID) AS OrderCount\nFROM Customers c\nLEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID\nGROUP BY c.CustomerID, c.CustomerName;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n* The `LEFT JOIN` ensures that all customers are included, even those without any orders.\n* The `COUNT(o.OrderID)` counts the number of orders per customer.\n* The `GROUP BY` groups the result by customer ID and name to aggregate the order count.\n",
    "evaluation": {
      "score": 9,
      "feedback": "The SQL query is correct and efficiently retrieves the desired result. The explanation is clear and concise, covering the key aspects of the query, including the use of `LEFT JOIN`, `COUNT()`, and `GROUP BY`. The answer addresses all requirements of the question, including handling customers with no orders. However, the explanation could benefit from explicitly mentioning how `COUNT(o.OrderID)` handles NULL values generated by the `LEFT JOIN` for customers with no orders. It implicitly returns zero for those customers since `COUNT()` ignores `NULL` values.",
      "strengths": [
        "Correct and efficient SQL query.",
        "Clear and concise explanation.",
        "Proper use of LEFT JOIN, COUNT(), and GROUP BY.",
        "Handles customers with no orders correctly."
      ],
      "areas_for_improvement": [
        "Explicitly mention that COUNT() ignores NULL values generated by the LEFT JOIN, leading to a count of 0 for customers with no orders."
      ],
      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Ask the candidate about alternative ways to achieve the same result (e.g., using a subquery).",
        "Ask the candidate how the query would change if they needed to filter the orders based on a specific date range."
