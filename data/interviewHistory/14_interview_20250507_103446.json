      "content": "Imagine you have a program that's running very slowly on your computer. How would you use a Task Manager (or Activity Monitor on macOS) to see if it's using too much CPU? Explain the steps you would take.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "What does a high CPU usage usually indicate?",
        "Besides CPU, what other resources might a slow program be using excessively?"

    },
    "answer": "To check if a program is using too much CPU:\n\n### On **Windows**:\n\n1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Esc` to open **Task Manager**.\n2. Go to the **Processes** tab and look at the **CPU** column to see which program is using the most CPU.\n3. If a program is using a high percentage (e.g., >50%), it might be slowing down your system.\n\n### On **macOS**:\n\n1. Open **Activity Monitor** (use Spotlight with `Cmd + Space`).\n2. Go to the **CPU** tab and check the **% CPU** column.\n3. Identify any programs using a large percentage of CPU and consider quitting them if necessary.\n",
    "evaluation": {
      "score": 8,
      "feedback": "The answer is good and provides accurate steps for both Windows and macOS. It correctly identifies how to open the Task Manager/Activity Monitor and how to find CPU usage. However, it could be improved by mentioning sorting by CPU usage to easily identify the culprit and providing a more nuanced understanding of what constitutes \"high\" CPU usage, considering the number of cores and the overall system load. Also, while it implies resource consumption is an issue, it doesn't explicitly state this.",
      "strengths": [
        "Accurate steps for opening Task Manager/Activity Monitor on both Windows and macOS.",
        "Correctly identifies the CPU column and its relevance.",
        "Easy to understand explanations for both operating systems."
      ],
      "areas_for_improvement": [
        "Doesn't explicitly mention sorting by CPU usage for easier identification of the offending process.",
        "The definition of \"high\" CPU usage is vague ('>50%'). A more nuanced explanation considering the number of cores and baseline system usage would be beneficial.",
        "Could explicitly state that high CPU usage indicates high resource consumption."
      ],
      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Explain how to sort processes by CPU usage in both Task Manager and Activity Monitor.",
        "Describe what constitutes 'high' CPU usage in more detail, considering the number of processor cores. For example, 25% on a quad-core system might be normal background activity, while 90% on a single core system is definitely an issue.",
        "Ask about what other factors besides CPU might be causing the slowdown."
