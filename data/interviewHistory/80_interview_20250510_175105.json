      "subtopic": "Socket Programming",
      "difficulty": 3.5,
      "content": "Imagine you're building a simple client-server application where the client sends a text message to the server, and the server echoes it back. Your initial implementation works fine on your local machine. However, when you deploy the server on a remote machine with a firewall, the client can connect to the server, but the server never echoes the message back. What is a likely cause of this issue, and how would you troubleshoot it using socket programming concepts?",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "What are some common socket programming errors that might cause this issue (e.g., related to binding, listening, or accepting connections)?",
        "How would you modify the server-side code to improve its error handling in this scenario (e.g., adding logging or specific exception handling)?"
      ],
      "evaluation_points": [
        "Firewall configuration is blocking outgoing traffic from the server.",
        "Server's `send()` call might be failing without proper error handling.",
        "The server may not be properly handling or acknowledging the received message.",
        "Basic socket programming concepts like `bind`, `listen`, `accept`, `recv`, and `send`."

      "feedback": "The response \"I dont know\" indicates a complete lack of understanding of the problem and demonstrates no knowledge of socket programming concepts or troubleshooting techniques. The candidate fails to identify any potential causes of the issue or suggest any methods for debugging the client-server application.",

        "Review basic socket programming tutorials and examples in your preferred language (e.g., Python, C++)",
        "Study common network troubleshooting techniques, including how firewalls work and how to configure them",
        "Practice writing simple client-server applications and deliberately introduce errors to learn how to debug them",
