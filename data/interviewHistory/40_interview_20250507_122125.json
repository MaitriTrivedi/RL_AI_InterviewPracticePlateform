      "content": "You are tasked with analyzing network traffic logs to detect Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks based on SYN flood. Each log entry contains a timestamp (in milliseconds since epoch) and the source IP address of a SYN request.  The data is provided as a stream of tuples `(timestamp, ip_address)`.  Assume the data stream is massive and cannot be fully stored in memory.\n\nA DoS attack is defined as follows: Within a sliding time window of `T` milliseconds, a single IP address sends more than `K` SYN requests.  Your goal is to design a highly efficient algorithm that can process this stream and identify the attacking IP addresses. The algorithm must operate in close to real-time, minimizing latency. Furthermore, consider that `T` is a tunable parameter that can vary significantly (e.g., from 1 second to 1 hour) and `K` can also be large (e.g., tens of thousands). The number of unique IP addresses in the stream can also be very high (millions).\n\nDescribe an algorithm to detect these attacks, paying close attention to memory usage and computational complexity.  You should consider data structures that can efficiently maintain counts within the sliding window without storing all individual timestamps for each IP.  Address how you would handle the large scale of IP addresses and the variability of `T` and `K`. Bonus points for considering the trade-offs between accuracy and resource consumption (e.g., using probabilistic data structures).",

The question requires knowledge of stream processing, data structures for approximate counting, and considerations for handling large-scale data. The response provides no algorithm, data structure, or discussion of trade-offs. The candidate provided absolutely no solution or attempted to address any part of the problem.
