      "content": "You are building a real-time analytics platform that processes a massive stream of user activity events. Each event contains a timestamp (in milliseconds since epoch), user ID, and event type. Your task is to design a system that can efficiently calculate and continuously update the top K most active users within a sliding time window of the last N milliseconds. Assume K is relatively small (e.g., K <= 100) but N is significantly large (e.g., N = 60,000, representing a 1-minute window). The event stream arrives at a rate of millions of events per second. Describe your approach, focusing on the data structures and algorithms used for maintaining and updating the top K active users, and explain how you handle the high throughput and large time window. Consider memory usage and processing latency. Specifically, how do you efficiently evict expired events while maintaining the sorted order for top K tracking, and how would you distribute the load across multiple machines if necessary?",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "How would you handle potential ties in activity counts among users? Which users should be prioritized in the top K?",
        "What are the tradeoffs between different data structures you considered (e.g., priority queue, sorted list, hash map combined with tree structure) regarding time complexity, space complexity, and implementation complexity?",
        "How would you monitor the performance of your system (e.g., event processing latency, memory consumption, CPU utilization) and detect potential bottlenecks?"
