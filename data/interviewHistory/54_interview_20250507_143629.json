      "subtopic": "OSI Model",
      "difficulty": 6.537219175493381,
      "content": "You are troubleshooting a network issue where a user can successfully ping a remote server by its IP address but cannot access the same server using its fully qualified domain name (FQDN) via HTTP/HTTPS. Assuming the DNS server is configured correctly and resolving the FQDN to the correct IP address, describe which layers of the OSI model are likely involved in this issue, and how you would systematically troubleshoot each layer to pinpoint the problem. Specifically, focus on the interaction between the Network Layer, Transport Layer, and Application Layer in this scenario. What tools could you use at each layer to aid in diagnosis?",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "What are some common causes for this type of issue at each of the layers you identified?",
        "How would your troubleshooting approach differ if the user could access *some* websites using FQDN but not others?"
      ],
      "evaluation_points": [
        "Identification of Network, Transport, and Application Layers as primary focus",
        "Understanding of DNS resolution and its role relative to the OSI model",
        "Ability to articulate troubleshooting steps at each layer (ping, traceroute, telnet, netcat, Wireshark, browser debugging)",
        "Awareness of potential issues like firewall rules, incorrect port configurations, TLS/SSL problems, proxy settings."

      "feedback": "The candidate stated they do not know the answer. This demonstrates a lack of understanding of fundamental networking concepts and troubleshooting methodologies related to the OSI model, DNS resolution, and common network issues. There's no evidence of understanding the interaction between the Network, Transport, and Application layers, or the appropriate tools for troubleshooting at each layer.",
