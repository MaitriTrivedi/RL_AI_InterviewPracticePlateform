      "content": "Consider a distributed e-commerce system where users can place orders. Each order triggers a complex workflow involving several microservices: Inventory Management, Payment Processing, Shipping Coordination, and Notification Service. Due to high traffic, the system experiences frequent failures in individual microservices. Design a robust and scalable process management solution that ensures order fulfillment even with these intermittent microservice failures. Specifically, address the following challenges:\n\n1.  **Fault Tolerance:** How can you guarantee that an order is eventually processed, even if a microservice crashes multiple times during the workflow?\n2.  **Idempotency:** How do you prevent duplicate processing of tasks, especially in scenarios where messages might be delivered more than once due to network issues?\n3.  **State Management:** How would you track the progress of each order across multiple microservices, ensuring that the system knows which steps have been completed and which need to be retried?\n4.  **Scalability:** How does your solution scale to handle a significant increase in order volume, potentially involving thousands of concurrent orders?\n5.  **Visibility and Monitoring:** How would you monitor the overall system health and track the status of individual orders to identify potential bottlenecks or errors?",

        "How would you handle long-running transactions that might span hours or even days?",
        "How would you design the data schema for persisting the state of the workflow? What are some considerations for optimizing data access for performance and fault tolerance?"
