      "difficulty": 5.170000000000001,
      "content": "You are designing a file system that uses a tree structure to represent directories and files. Each node in the tree represents either a directory or a file. A directory can have multiple children (other directories or files), while a file is a leaf node. Implement a function `findLargestFileSize(root)` that takes the root of the file system tree as input and returns the size (in bytes) of the largest file in the entire file system.  The `Node` class is defined as follows:\n\n```python\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, name, size, children=None):\n        self.name = name  # Name of the directory or file\n        self.size = size  # Size in bytes (0 for directories)\n        self.children = children if children is not None else [] # List of child nodes\n```\n\nExplain the time and space complexity of your solution. Consider handling edge cases like an empty file system (root is None).",

        "How would you modify your solution if you needed to find the path to the largest file?",

No code was provided, and no analysis was attempted. The response fails to address the core problem of traversing a tree structure to find the largest file size and does not provide any implementation or analysis.",
