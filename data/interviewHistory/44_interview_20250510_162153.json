      "content": "You have a `users` table with columns `id`, `username`, and `email`. You frequently run queries to retrieve users by their email address. The `users` table currently doesn't have any indexes. Describe how you would add an index to improve the performance of these email-based queries and explain *why* adding this index would likely make the queries faster.",
