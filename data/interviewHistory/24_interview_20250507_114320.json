      "difficulty": 4.992117231947836,
      "content": "Design a database schema to represent a simplified online course platform. The platform needs to track courses, users, enrollments, and progress. Consider the following requirements:\n\n*   Each course has a title, description, and a unique course ID.\n*   Each user has a username, email, and a unique user ID.\n*   Users can enroll in multiple courses.\n*   For each enrollment, track the enrollment date.\n*   Each course consists of multiple modules. Each module has a title, content (assume text-based), and module ID.\n*   Track the progress of each user in each module of a course they're enrolled in. Progress is represented as a percentage (0-100).\n\nProvide a schema diagram or a list of tables with their columns and data types. Explain your design choices, especially regarding relationships between tables and handling the user progress feature.",

        "How would you optimize your schema to efficiently retrieve all courses a specific user is enrolled in and their overall progress across those courses?",

        "Correctly identifies and defines the entities: Courses, Users, Enrollments, Modules, and Progress.",

    "answer": "Here\u2019s a simplified flow for the database schema design:\n\n### 1. **Users Table**\n\n* **user\\_id** (Primary Key) \u2013 INT\n* **username** \u2013 VARCHAR\n* **email** \u2013 VARCHAR (unique)\n\nThis table holds basic information about users (students) on the platform.\n\n### 2. **Courses Table**\n\n* **course\\_id** (Primary Key) \u2013 INT\n* **title** \u2013 VARCHAR\n* **description** \u2013 TEXT\n\nThis table stores details about each course offered on the platform.\n\n### 3. **Modules Table**\n\n* **module\\_id** (Primary Key) \u2013 INT\n* **course\\_id** (Foreign Key) \u2013 INT (references Courses(course\\_id))\n* **title** \u2013 VARCHAR\n* **content** \u2013 TEXT\n\nThis table contains the different modules that belong to each course. The `course_id` links modules to their respective courses.\n\n### 4. **Enrollments Table**\n\n* **enrollment\\_id** (Primary Key) \u2013 INT\n* **user\\_id** (Foreign Key) \u2013 INT (references Users(user\\_id))\n* **course\\_id** (Foreign Key) \u2013 INT (references Courses(course\\_id))\n* **enrollment\\_date** \u2013 DATE\n\nThis table tracks the enrollment of users in courses. A user can be enrolled in multiple courses, and each record will include the date of enrollment.\n\n### 5. **Progress Table**\n\n* **progress\\_id** (Primary Key) \u2013 INT\n* **user\\_id** (Foreign Key) \u2013 INT (references Users(user\\_id))\n* **module\\_id** (Foreign Key) \u2013 INT (references Modules(module\\_id))\n* **progress\\_percentage** \u2013 INT (0-100)\n\nThis table tracks the progress of each user in each module of the courses they\u2019re enrolled in. It stores the progress as a percentage for each module.\n\n### **Relationships Explained**:\n\n* A **User** can enroll in multiple **Courses** through the **Enrollments** table (many-to-many).\n* A **Course** consists of multiple **Modules** (one-to-many).\n* A **User's progress** in each **Module** is tracked separately, linking users and modules in the **Progress** table (many-to-many).\n\nThis design ensures:\n\n* Data normalization (avoiding data duplication).\n* Flexibility to track multiple users, courses, modules, and enrollment histories.\n* The ability to update and track progress on a per-module basis while keeping the system extensible.\n",
    "evaluation": {
      "score": 9,
      "feedback": "The response is well-structured, technically accurate, and clearly explains the database schema design. The student correctly identifies all the necessary entities (Users, Courses, Modules, Enrollments, and Progress) and establishes appropriate relationships between them. The data types chosen are suitable for their respective columns. The handling of the many-to-many relationships between Users and Courses (Enrollments table) and Users and Modules (Progress table) is also correctly implemented. The explanation of the relationships and the design's benefits (data normalization, flexibility, extensibility) demonstrates a good understanding of database design principles. Using separate tables to capture enrollment and progress is the standard and expected approach.  Overall, the answer is excellent and demonstrates a strong understanding of database design.",
