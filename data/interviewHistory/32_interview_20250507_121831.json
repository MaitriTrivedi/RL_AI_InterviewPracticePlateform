      "content": "Imagine you are designing a highly scalable distributed system for processing financial transactions. Each transaction can be of various types (e.g., Stock Trade, Wire Transfer, Cryptocurrency Exchange) and requires different validation and processing steps. Your system must support adding new transaction types dynamically without modifying core components, and each transaction type needs to interact with different, potentially remote, data sources (databases, APIs). Furthermore, you have a centralized logging and auditing mechanism that requires a unified interface for all transactions. \n\nUsing advanced polymorphism techniques (e.g., type erasure, CRTP, or similar patterns), design a robust and flexible system that effectively handles this scenario. Specifically, address the following challenges:\n\n1.  How would you define a generic transaction processing pipeline that can accommodate varying transaction types and their specific logic, promoting code reuse and maintainability?\n2.  How can you ensure type safety and avoid runtime errors when dealing with dynamically added transaction types?\n3.  How will you abstract away the specifics of data source interactions for each transaction type, allowing for independent scaling and maintenance of these sources?\n4.  How will you enforce a consistent logging and auditing standard across all transaction types without introducing tight coupling?\n\nExplain your design choices, including the chosen polymorphism technique(s), their advantages and disadvantages in this context, and potential trade-offs.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "How does your design handle error conditions and exceptions specific to each transaction type, while maintaining a consistent error reporting mechanism for the overall system?",
        "Discuss the performance implications of your chosen polymorphism technique, particularly in the context of high-volume transaction processing.  Are there alternative approaches that could offer better performance at the cost of increased complexity or reduced flexibility?",
        "How would your design change if some transaction types require asynchronous processing or involve complex state transitions? Consider the challenges of managing concurrent access and data consistency."

The answer demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of advanced polymorphism techniques and distributed system design.
