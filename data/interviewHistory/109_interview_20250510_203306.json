      "subtopic": "DNS/DHCP",
      "difficulty": 7.414892639636951,
      "content": "Imagine you are designing a highly available and scalable DHCP service for a large, geographically distributed organization with numerous branch offices and a centralized headquarters. This organization is migrating to a new IP addressing scheme (IPv6) while still needing to support IPv4 for legacy devices. They also have strict security requirements. Describe your proposed DHCP architecture, including failover mechanisms, IPv4/IPv6 coexistence strategies, security considerations (like rogue DHCP server detection and prevention), and techniques for minimizing DHCP broadcast traffic across the WAN links between branch offices and headquarters. Specifically address how you would implement a DHCPv6 server with Prefix Delegation and how you would handle DHCP option configuration across different device types (e.g., laptops, VoIP phones, IoT devices). Justify your architectural choices considering the organization's size, geographical distribution, and security needs.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "How would you monitor the health and performance of your DHCP service across all locations, and what metrics would you focus on?",
        "Explain how you would integrate your DHCP solution with the organization's existing DNS infrastructure to ensure seamless address resolution for both IPv4 and IPv6 devices.",
        "If a branch office experiences a prolonged WAN outage, how would devices in that branch office continue to obtain IP addresses and network configuration?"
      ],
      "evaluation_points": [
        "High availability and failover mechanisms (e.g., DHCP failover protocol, VRRP, keepalived)",
        "IPv4/IPv6 coexistence strategies (e.g., dual-stack, DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation)",
        "Security measures (e.g., DHCP snooping, rogue DHCP server detection/prevention, DHCP relay agent information option)",
        "Optimization of DHCP traffic over WAN links (e.g., DHCP relay agents, unicast DHCP)",
        "DHCP option management (e.g., DHCP option policies, vendor-specific options)",
        "Integration with DNS and address resolution",
        "Handling WAN outages and local IP address assignment"

    "evaluation": {
      "score": 0,
      "feedback": "The candidate stated they don't know the answer. This indicates a lack of knowledge regarding DHCP architecture, IPv4/IPv6 coexistence, security considerations, and optimization techniques in a large, distributed environment. The response offers no insights into failover mechanisms, prefix delegation, or DHCP option management. The complete lack of information demonstrates a significant gap in understanding networking concepts essential for a system administrator or network engineer role.",
