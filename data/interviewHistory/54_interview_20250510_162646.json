      "subtopic": "Database Design",
      "difficulty": 5.0,
      "content": "You are designing a database for an online bookstore. The bookstore needs to store information about books (title, author, ISBN, publication date, price), customers (name, address, email, phone number), and orders (order ID, customer ID, order date, shipping address, total amount). Consider that the bookstore expects a significant increase in sales over the next year. How would you design the database schema, focusing on handling a large volume of orders and efficient querying of book information, and what indexing strategies would you employ to optimize performance?",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "How would you handle the scenario where a customer places an order for multiple books?",
        "What are the tradeoffs between different indexing strategies (e.g., B-tree vs. full-text index) for the book database?",
        "How would you monitor the database performance and identify potential bottlenecks?"
      ],
      "evaluation_points": [
        "Normalization of tables (Books, Customers, Orders, Order_Items)",
        "Appropriate data types for each attribute",

    "answer": "To design a scalable database for an online bookstore, I would create the following tables:\n\n1. **Books**: Columns like `book_id`, `title`, `author`, `isbn`, `publication_date`, and `price`.\n\n   * **Indexes**: `isbn` for fast lookups, `author` for search by author, `title` for search by title.\n\n2. **Customers**: Columns like `customer_id`, `name`, `address`, `email`, `phone_number`.\n\n   * **Indexes**: `email` for fast lookups, `name` for searching customer orders.\n\n3. **Orders**: Columns like `order_id`, `customer_id`, `order_date`, `shipping_address`, `total_amount`.\n\n   * **Indexes**: `customer_id`, `order_date` for fast order history queries.\n\n4. **Order\\_Items**: Columns like `order_item_id`, `order_id`, `book_id`, `quantity`, `price`.\n\n   * **Indexes**: Composite index on `order_id` and `book_id` for efficient joins.\n\n**Indexing Strategies**:\n\n* **Primary and unique indexes** for keys like `isbn`, `email`, `order_id`.\n* **Composite indexes** for common query patterns (e.g., `customer_id` and `order_date` for order history).\n\n### Performance Tips:\n\n* **Sharding** for the `orders` table.\n* **Read replicas** for read-heavy operations.\n* **Caching** for popular products and orders.\n\nThis design ensures scalability, fast queries, and efficient handling of increased sales.\n",

      "feedback": "The response provides a good foundation for designing a scalable database for an online bookstore. The table structures are reasonable and include important attributes. The inclusion of `Order_Items` is excellent and demonstrates understanding of normalization. The indexing strategies are mostly appropriate for the specified query patterns. The performance tips, such as sharding, read replicas, and caching, are valuable for scalability. However, the answer could be strengthened by explicitly stating primary keys for each table, clarifying the data types for each attribute, and elaborating on the specific benefits of each performance optimization technique in the context of the bookstore's needs. A small area for improvement would be explicitly stating which foreign keys relate to which tables.",
      "strengths": [
        "Well-structured table design including Books, Customers, Orders, and Order_Items.",
        "Appropriate use of indexing to optimize query performance.",
        "Inclusion of performance tips like sharding, read replicas, and caching demonstrates awareness of scalability concerns."

      "areas_for_improvement": [
        "Missing explicit declaration of primary keys for each table.",
        "Lack of specific data type definitions for each attribute.",
        "Could elaborate on the reasoning behind choosing sharding specifically for the `orders` table, read replicas, and caching in the context of the online bookstore."
      ],
      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Describe the data types you would choose for each column in each table (e.g., INT, VARCHAR, DATE). Justify your choices.",
        "Explain how you would implement sharding for the `Orders` table, including the sharding key and potential challenges.",
        "Discuss other indexing strategies that might be useful based on different query patterns, such as full-text search for book titles or author names."
