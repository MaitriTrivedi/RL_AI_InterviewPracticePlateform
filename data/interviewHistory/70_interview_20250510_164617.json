      "content": "You are designing a real-time news aggregation service that collects articles from thousands of different news sources worldwide. Each article is represented as a JSON object with properties like `title`, `content`, `author`, `publication_date`, and a unique `article_id`. Users can subscribe to specific news topics (e.g., \"Technology\", \"Politics\", \"Sports\") and receive personalized feeds. Due to high demand, latency is critical: users expect near-instantaneous updates. News sources frequently update their articles, and consistency is paramount \u2013 users should always see the latest version of an article, even if it means slightly delaying an update. Design a multi-layered caching strategy that addresses these constraints, focusing on minimizing read latency, maintaining eventual consistency (with strong preference towards immediacy), and minimizing the load on the backend database. Your design should incorporate at least two distinct caching layers (e.g., in-memory, distributed) and explain the rationale behind each layer's selection, eviction policies, data invalidation strategies, and handling of cache misses. Specifically address how you would manage updates to articles originating from different news sources and propagate these changes through your cache layers while ensuring data integrity and minimizing staleness. Furthermore, discuss how you would handle scenarios where a specific news source experiences a sudden spike in article updates, potentially overloading the system.",

        "How would you monitor and measure the effectiveness of your caching strategy, including metrics like cache hit ratio, latency, and data staleness?",

        "How would you handle situations where the cache becomes corrupted or unavailable? What fallback mechanisms would you implement to ensure service availability?"

      "feedback": "The answer is missing. There is no design provided for a multi-layered caching strategy. Without a design, it's impossible to assess the technical accuracy, completeness, clarity, or practical application of the solution. The answer needs to include specific details about the caching layers used, eviction policies, invalidation strategies, concurrency control mechanisms, and strategies for handling hotspots and cache failures.",
