      "content": "You are developing a system for processing different types of financial transactions (e.g., credit card payments, bank transfers, cryptocurrency transactions). Each transaction type has its own unique processing steps (validation, authorization, settlement). You are given the following interface:\n\n```java\ninterface TransactionProcessor {\n    void processTransaction(Transaction transaction);\n}\n\nclass Transaction {\n    String type; // \"credit_card\", \"bank_transfer\", \"crypto\"\n    double amount;\n    // Other transaction details\n}\n```\n\nImplement a solution using Abstraction to handle the varying processing logic for each transaction type. Your solution should minimize code duplication and allow for easy addition of new transaction types in the future.  Specifically, focus on how you would handle the `processTransaction` method. Do *not* implement specific validation, authorization or settlement logic, just show how you would abstract those processes so different transaction types can implement them in their own way.  Explain why your chosen approach is appropriate. Show code for the base abstract class and at least two concrete transaction processor classes.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "How would you handle transaction-specific exceptions or error codes within your abstraction?",
        "How would you modify your solution to support a transaction requiring multiple processors to execute different stages (e.g., validation and authorization)?",
        "How does the choice of using abstract classes versus interfaces influence the flexibility and extensibility of your design in this scenario?"

      "feedback": "The candidate stated they 'don't know', indicating a complete lack of understanding or inability to apply the requested abstraction concepts to solve the problem. No code was provided, and no explanation was given. This demonstrates a significant gap in the candidate's knowledge of object-oriented programming principles, specifically abstraction and inheritance.",
