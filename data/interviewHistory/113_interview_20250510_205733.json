      "content": "You are given a sorted array of integers called `numbers`. Your task is to determine if there exist two numbers in the array that sum up to a specific target value called `target`. Implement a function `hasPairWithSum(numbers, target)` that returns `true` if such a pair exists and `false` otherwise. You must use the two-pointer approach for optimal efficiency.",

    "answer": "The two-pointer technique works well for this problem because the array is already sorted. You can initialize two pointers: one at the beginning (`left`) and one at the end (`right`) of the array. Then, check the sum of the numbers at these pointers:\n\n* If the sum equals the target, return `true`.\n* If the sum is less than the target, move the `left` pointer to the right to increase the sum.\n* If the sum is greater than the target, move the `right` pointer to the left to decrease the sum.\n* Continue until the pointers cross.\n\nHere is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef hasPairWithSum(numbers, target):\n    left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1\n    \n    while left < right:\n        current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]\n        \n        if current_sum == target:\n            return True\n        elif current_sum < target:\n            left += 1\n        else:\n            right -= 1\n    \n    return False\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start with two pointers, `left` at the beginning (index 0) and `right` at the end (index `len(numbers) - 1`).\n2. **Loop**: Check the sum of the numbers at these pointers. Adjust the pointers based on whether the sum is less than or greater than the target.\n3. **Exit condition**: If the pointers cross (i.e., `left >= right`), and no pair has been found, return `false`.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the `numbers` array, making it efficient for large arrays.\n",

      "feedback": "The answer is excellent. It correctly implements the two-pointer approach, provides a clear explanation of the algorithm, and correctly identifies the time complexity as O(n). The code is clean, concise, and easy to understand. The explanation covers the initialization, loop condition, pointer adjustments, and exit condition effectively. The answer also correctly highlights the importance of the sorted input for the algorithm's efficiency.",
