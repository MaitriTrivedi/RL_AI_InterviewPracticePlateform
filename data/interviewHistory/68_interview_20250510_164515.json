      "content": "You are designing a geographically distributed, multi-master database system for a global e-commerce platform that needs to handle millions of transactions per second. This platform requires strong consistency for critical financial transactions (e.g., payments, refunds) but can tolerate eventual consistency for non-critical operations like product catalog updates and user reviews. \n\nGiven the CAP theorem, describe a system architecture that appropriately balances consistency, availability, and partition tolerance for these different types of operations. Specifically, address the following:\n\n1.  Explain how you would architect the system to ensure ACID properties for financial transactions, and what trade-offs you would make concerning availability and latency in the presence of network partitions.\n2.  Detail the mechanisms you would employ for handling concurrent writes to the same data across different data centers during network partitions. Describe a concrete conflict resolution strategy and its impact on data integrity and user experience.\n3.  Outline a strategy for dynamically adapting your consistency levels based on network conditions. How would you detect and respond to network partitions or increased latency in a data center? Consider both automated and manual intervention scenarios.",

        "Explain your approach to data versioning and how it contributes to maintaining data integrity during and after network partitions."
