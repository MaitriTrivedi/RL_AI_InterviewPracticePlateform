      "topic": "os",
      "subtopic": "CPU Scheduling",
      "difficulty": 4.5,
      "content": "Imagine you're building a simple task scheduler for a robotic arm that performs assembly line operations. This arm needs to alternate between two tasks: 'Welding' (high CPU, short duration) and 'Inspection' (low CPU, long duration). Explain how you would use a Priority Scheduling algorithm to ensure the 'Welding' task (critical for product completion) is always given preference, while still allowing the 'Inspection' task to eventually run and maintain quality control.  Assume the system cannot tolerate starvation of the 'Inspection' task.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "How would you assign priority values to 'Welding' and 'Inspection' tasks?",
        "How can you modify the Priority Scheduling algorithm to prevent the 'Inspection' task from being starved, even if 'Welding' tasks are frequently added to the queue?"
      ],
      "evaluation_points": [
        "Understanding of Priority Scheduling and its limitations (starvation).",
        "Ability to propose a simple solution to avoid starvation, such as aging or dynamic priority adjustment.",
        "Understanding that 'Welding' needs a higher priority initially."

      "expected_time_minutes": 15
    },
    "answer": "To implement **Priority Scheduling** for the robotic arm:\n\n1. **Assign Priorities**:\n\n   * **Welding**: High priority (because it\u2019s critical for product completion).\n   * **Inspection**: Low priority (important but can wait longer due to its lower CPU demand).\n\n2. **Scheduling Logic**:\n\n   * The scheduler gives **Welding** tasks higher priority and allows them to preempt **Inspection**.\n   * However, to avoid **starvation** of the **Inspection** task, introduce a **time slice** or **quantum** for low-priority tasks. After a set amount of time, the system can give the **Inspection** task a chance to run, ensuring fairness.\n\n3. **Handling Starvation**:\n\n   * Implement a **starvation prevention mechanism**: periodically allocate CPU time for the **Inspection** task even when **Welding** tasks are frequent, ensuring it eventually runs.\n\nThis approach ensures high-priority tasks (Welding) get processed quickly while guaranteeing that lower-priority tasks (Inspection) also execute without indefinite delay.\n",

      "score": 7,
      "feedback": "The answer demonstrates a good understanding of Priority Scheduling and the potential for starvation. The solution proposes assigning priorities and using a time slice to avoid starvation, which is a valid approach. However, the explanation could be more detailed and provide more specific implementation details. For example, the answer doesn't elaborate on how the time slice for the 'Inspection' task is determined or adjusted. Also, while mentioning a 'starvation prevention mechanism', it could be more specific about the mechanism itself. The use of terms like 'time slice' and 'quantum' somewhat blend two different concepts; priority scheduling itself doesn't inherently involve time slices unless combined with a time-sharing approach at each priority level.",
      "strengths": [
        "Correctly identifies the need for priority scheduling and assigns priorities to tasks.",
        "Recognizes the potential for starvation and proposes a solution.",
        "Clear explanation of the basic scheduling logic."

      "areas_for_improvement": [
        "Lacks specific details on the starvation prevention mechanism. Simply stating 'periodically allocate CPU time' is vague.",
        "Could be more precise in differentiating between time-sharing and priority scheduling concepts.",
        "Could explore dynamic priority adjustment (aging) as an alternative or complementary solution to time slicing."
      ],
      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "How would you dynamically adjust the priority of the 'Inspection' task over time if it hasn't run in a while? Explain the algorithm you would use.",
        "Discuss the trade-offs between using a fixed time slice for 'Inspection' and dynamically adjusting its priority. Which approach is more suitable for this specific scenario and why?",
        "How would you measure the 'CPU demand' of the Inspection task to dynamically adjust its priority?"
