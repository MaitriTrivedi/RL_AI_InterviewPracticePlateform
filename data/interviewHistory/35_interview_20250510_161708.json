      "content": "Imagine you're building a simple application to process log files. Your application needs to read multiple log files concurrently and count the occurrences of a specific keyword (e.g., 'ERROR') in each file.  Design a multithreaded solution to achieve this. Focus on how you would divide the work among threads, ensure thread safety when updating the total error count, and prevent potential race conditions. Provide code snippets (or pseudocode) demonstrating your approach to thread creation, task assignment, and synchronization. Assume you have a `countOccurrences(String filename, String keyword)` function that efficiently counts occurrences in a single file. You don't need to handle file I/O; focus on the threading aspect.",

    "answer": "To design a multithreaded solution for counting keyword occurrences across multiple log files, we can break the work into manageable chunks using **threads**. Each thread will process one log file, and at the end, the results will be combined in a thread-safe manner to avoid race conditions when updating the total error count.\n\n### Approach:\n\n1. **Divide the Work Among Threads**:\n\n   * Each log file is assigned to a separate thread.\n   * We will use a **thread pool** or manually create threads depending on the number of log files.\n\n2. **Ensure Thread Safety**:\n\n   * To avoid race conditions when updating the total error count, we\u2019ll use **mutexes** (or **locks**) to synchronize access to shared resources (the `total_error_count`).\n\n3. **Thread Synchronization**:\n\n   * Each thread will process a single log file, and once the file is processed, it will report the count to the main thread.\n   * We\u2019ll aggregate the results in a thread-safe manner.\n\n### Code Snippet (Python-style pseudocode):\n\n```python\nimport threading\n\n# Global variable for total error count (shared resource)\ntotal_error_count = 0\n# Lock to ensure thread safety when updating the global error count\nlock = threading.Lock()\n\n# Function to count occurrences of the keyword in a file\ndef countOccurrences(filename, keyword):\n    count = 0\n    # Read the file (assuming it's already done)\n    # for line in open(filename, 'r'):\n    #     count += line.count(keyword)\n    # For demonstration purposes, assume the count is returned.\n    return count  # Just an example\n\n# Thread worker function\ndef count_errors_in_file(filename, keyword):\n    global total_error_count\n    \n    # Get the count of occurrences in the current file\n    count = countOccurrences(filename, keyword)\n    \n    # Use lock to ensure only one thread updates the global count at a time\n    with lock:\n        total_error_count += count\n\n# Main function to create threads and process log files\ndef process_log_files(log_files, keyword):\n    threads = []\n    \n    # Create and start threads\n    for file in log_files:\n        thread = threading.Thread(target=count_errors_in_file, args=(file, keyword))\n        threads.append(thread)\n        thread.start()\n\n    # Wait for all threads to complete\n    for thread in threads:\n        thread.join()\n\n# Example Usage\nlog_files = [\"log1.txt\", \"log2.txt\", \"log3.txt\"]\nkeyword = \"ERROR\"\nprocess_log_files(log_files, keyword)\n\n# After all threads complete, print the total count of occurrences\nprint(f\"Total occurrences of '{keyword}': {total_error_count}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Thread Creation**:\n\n   * The `process_log_files` function creates a thread for each log file. Each thread will invoke `count_errors_in_file` to count the occurrences of the `keyword` in its assigned log file.\n\n2. **Thread Safety with Lock**:\n\n   * The global variable `total_error_count` holds the cumulative count of the keyword occurrences across all files. To safely update this value from multiple threads, we use a **lock** (`lock` in this case).\n   * The lock is acquired in the `count_errors_in_file` function when updating `total_error_count`, ensuring that only one thread modifies it at a time.\n\n3. **Thread Joining**:\n\n   * After starting all the threads, the `join()` method is used to ensure that the main program waits for all threads to finish before printing the total count.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n\n* **Efficiency**: Each thread works on a separate log file, meaning the work is done concurrently, speeding up the process if the number of files is large.\n* **Thread Safety**: The use of the lock ensures that the update to `total_error_count` is done in a thread-safe manner, preventing race conditions.\n* **Scalability**: This approach scales well with the number of log files, as each file is handled by a separate thread, and the number of threads can be adjusted to match the available CPU resources. If there are too many threads, you can limit the number of concurrently running threads by using a thread pool.\n",

      "feedback": "The answer provides a solid multithreaded solution to the log file processing problem. The code demonstrates proper thread creation, task assignment, and synchronization using a lock. The explanation is clear and covers the key aspects of thread safety and race conditions. The use of Python-style pseudocode is acceptable given the prompt's instructions. The design is reasonable, assigning each file to a separate thread and aggregating results safely. The candidate acknowledges the need for a thread pool if the number of files becomes too large, indicating an understanding of scalability considerations. However, a more complete answer could include details on thread pool usage and potential error handling strategies for file processing within each thread.",
