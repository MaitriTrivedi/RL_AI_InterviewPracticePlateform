      "difficulty": 2.6833333333333327,
      "content": "You are analyzing network traffic data. You have a stream of packet sizes represented as an array of integers.  Your task is to find the average packet size over a sliding window of `k` packets. Given an array `packets` of packet sizes and an integer `k` representing the window size, write a function to calculate the average packet size for each window as it slides through the array. You should return an array containing these averages. For example, if `packets = [1, 3, 2, 6, -1, 4, 1, 8, 2]` and `k = 3`, the output should be `[2.0, 3.66667, 2.33333, 3.0, 1.33333, 4.33333, 3.66667]`. You can assume `k` is always a valid window size (1 <= k <= len(packets)). Focus on clarity and efficiency.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "What is the time complexity of your solution?",
        "How would you handle edge cases if the input array `packets` is empty or `k` is equal to the length of `packets`?"

        "Correct implementation of the sliding window",
        "Efficient calculation of the average within each window (avoiding recalculating the sum each time)",

      "score": 0,
      "feedback": "The candidate stated that they do not know how to solve the problem. This indicates a lack of understanding of basic sliding window techniques and array manipulation. The candidate demonstrated no understanding of the problem, provided no code, and offered no explanation. This results in a zero score.",
