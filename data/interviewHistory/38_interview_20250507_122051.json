      "content": "A large retail chain, 'GlobalMart', has recently implemented a new point-of-sale (POS) system across all of its stores. Shortly after deployment, multiple stores report intermittent connectivity issues where POS terminals sporadically lose network access. Initial investigations point to possible DHCP lease exhaustion during peak hours. You've been tasked with analyzing the DHCP configuration and proposing solutions to mitigate this issue, considering the following constraints: Each store uses a single DHCP server. Lease times are currently set to 24 hours. There is no centralized management platform for DHCP servers; each store's DHCP server must be configured independently.  How would you approach this problem, what specific DHCP configurations would you examine, and what solutions would you propose, considering the constraints?",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "How would you monitor the DHCP server utilization in this scenario, given the lack of centralized management?",
        "Beyond DHCP lease time and address range, what other DHCP options might you consider adjusting to improve the situation, and why?",
        "If the issue persisted even after your proposed DHCP changes, what other potential network problems would you investigate?"
