      "content": "Consider a scenario where you are designing a large-scale, multi-tenant cloud infrastructure. You need to allocate IPv6 addresses to virtual machines (VMs) within each tenant's virtual network. Each tenant requires its own isolated network, and you are using a /48 prefix per tenant for maximum flexibility and future growth. To optimize IPv6 address utilization and routing efficiency, you are considering different approaches:\n\n1.  Assigning a /64 prefix to each VM directly from the tenant's /48, using SLAAC for configuration.\n2.  Implementing Network Address Translation (NAT66) with a smaller prefix allocated to the VM, say a /112, and managing internal addresses within that prefix.\n3.  Using a combination of Network Virtualization Overlay (NVO) technologies like VXLAN or Geneve in conjunction with address assignment from the /48 prefix. You can assign VMs a /64 prefix within the VXLAN/Geneve overlay networks. \n\nDiscuss the advantages and disadvantages of each approach, considering aspects such as address exhaustion within the tenant's /48, complexity of implementation, performance overhead, security implications (including potential for address spoofing), and compatibility with existing network monitoring and management tools. Specifically analyze the implications of potential ICMPv6 issues, security vulnerability to NDP spoofing and the complexity when considering troubleshooting network issues and their root cause.",
