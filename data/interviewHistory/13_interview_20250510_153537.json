      "content": "Imagine a social network where users are represented as nodes and friendships as edges. Explain how Breadth-First Search (BFS) could be used to find all the users who are within two degrees of friendship from a given starting user.  Give a step-by-step explanation using a simple example with 5-6 users and connections you create.",

It doesn't even attempt to address the question. The response lacks any technical accuracy, completeness, or clarity. There is no practical application demonstrated.",
