    "answer": "A **stored procedure** is a precompiled collection of one or more SQL statements stored in the database. It can be executed by calling its name from an application or another SQL script.\n\n**Primary Benefit**: The main advantage of stored procedures is improved **performance** (due to precompilation) and **security** (by encapsulating complex SQL logic, reducing the risk of SQL injection). They also promote **reusability** and **maintainability**, as logic is centralized in the database, not spread across application code.\n",
    "evaluation": {
      "score": 8,
      "feedback": "The answer provides a good definition of a stored procedure and highlights several key benefits. It correctly identifies precompilation, security against SQL injection, reusability, and maintainability as advantages. However, it misses a crucial aspect related to network traffic, which is a key differentiator compared to embedding SQL directly in application code. The answer could also benefit from a more concrete example to illustrate the practical benefits.",

        "Explain how stored procedures reduce network traffic by only sending the procedure name to the database instead of the entire SQL statement.",
        "Provide a specific scenario (e.g., a complex reporting query) and explain how using a stored procedure would improve performance, security, and maintainability compared to embedding the query directly in application code."
