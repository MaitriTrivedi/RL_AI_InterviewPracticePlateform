      "subtopic": "Recursion",
      "difficulty": 10.0,
      "content": "Imagine you're designing a system to analyze the structural integrity of a complex, recursively defined mechanical assembly represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Each node in the graph represents a component, and an edge represents a physical connection between components. Each component has a 'stress_capacity' (an integer) representing its maximum stress tolerance. The 'applied_stress' on a component is calculated as the sum of the 'stress_capacity' values of all its immediate child components (components connected by outgoing edges). A component is considered 'stable' if its 'applied_stress' is less than or equal to its 'stress_capacity'. Design a recursive algorithm, `isAssemblyStable(assembly_graph, component_id)`, to determine if the entire assembly is structurally stable. The algorithm should efficiently detect and handle cycles (even though the assembly is supposed to be a DAG - errors happen!), potentially leading to infinite recursion, and optimize for memory usage (large assemblies are common). Note that the `assembly_graph` is provided as an adjacency list (dictionary where the key is the component ID and the value is a list of the child component IDs). The `component_stress_capacities` are provided as a dictionary (key is component ID and value is an integer representing the stress capacity). Assume that both dictionaries are global. The goal is not just to return true/false for whether the whole assembly is stable, but also to identify unstable components if the assembly is not stable. Return a tuple: (is_stable, list_of_unstable_component_ids).",

The prompt required a recursive algorithm with cycle detection, memoization, and handling of edge cases like missing stress capacities. The student demonstrated none of these.
