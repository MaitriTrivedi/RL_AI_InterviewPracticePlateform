      "subtopic": "CAP Theorem",
      "difficulty": 7.216021883728141,
      "content": "You are designing a globally distributed e-commerce platform. The platform needs to handle high volumes of transactions and maintain a consistent user experience. Specifically, users should always see up-to-date product inventory, even during network partitions between data centers. Given the CAP theorem, and the criticality of inventory data consistency for business operations, describe your chosen architectural approach, considering the trade-offs and potential edge cases. Explain how your chosen architecture would handle a scenario where there's a temporary but significant network partition between the US and Europe data centers lasting for 30 minutes. Address how eventual consistency could be implemented without negatively impacting user experience during this failure scenario. Discuss what kind of conflict resolution strategy would be used if inventory updates happen on both sides of the partition during the failure.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "How would you monitor and detect network partitions in your system? What metrics would you track?",
        "Let's say the partition extends beyond 30 minutes. At what point would you consider manually intervening, and what specific actions would you take?",
        "Describe a situation where choosing AP (Availability and Partition Tolerance) might be more beneficial for a different component of the same e-commerce platform (e.g., product recommendations), and why."

      "evaluation_points": [
        "Clear articulation of CAP theorem trade-offs and justification for the chosen approach (CP or AP)",
        "Detailed explanation of the consistency model used (e.g., strong consistency, eventual consistency with specific reconciliation strategies)",
        "Discussion of practical strategies for handling network partitions and conflict resolution (e.g., vector clocks, last-write-wins, application-specific logic)",
        "Explanation of how user experience is maintained during failure scenarios (e.g., stale reads with notifications, optimistic updates with error handling)",
        "Consideration of edge cases and potential failure modes, along with mitigation strategies"

      "feedback": "The response \"Don't know the answer\" indicates a complete lack of understanding and inability to address the core concepts of distributed systems, CAP theorem, consistency models, and failure handling in a distributed e-commerce platform. No attempt was made to reason about the problem, propose a solution, or even acknowledge the relevant concepts. This demonstrates a critical gap in knowledge for a senior engineering role or someone expected to work on such a system.",
