      "difficulty": 8.04057475755569,
      "content": "Your company provides a globally distributed video streaming service with millions of concurrent users. You're using a multi-tiered load balancing architecture consisting of: 1) Global Load Balancers (GLBs) distributing traffic across geographic regions, 2) Regional Load Balancers (RLBs) distributing traffic across Availability Zones (AZs) within each region, and 3) Application Load Balancers (ALBs) distributing traffic to individual video streaming servers within each AZ. A sudden spike in viewership in Southeast Asia overwhelms the capacity of your Singapore region (singapore-1). Describe a comprehensive strategy to handle this surge while minimizing latency for users in that region and preventing cascading failures across your infrastructure. Your strategy should address the following aspects:\n\n*   **Dynamic Capacity Management:** How will you dynamically provision additional resources to handle the load, considering infrastructure-as-code (IaC) principles and auto-scaling policies?\n*   **Traffic Rerouting and Load Shedding:** How would you strategically reroute traffic from the Singapore region to other regions (e.g., Japan, Australia) without significantly impacting latency for users in those regions or violating data residency requirements (if any)? Consider latency-based routing and weighted distribution.\n*   **Failure Domain Isolation:** How do you ensure the failure in singapore-1 doesn't propagate to other regions? Discuss the role of health checks, circuit breakers, and throttling mechanisms at each tier of the load balancing architecture.\n*   **Edge Caching Considerations:** Discuss how edge caching (e.g., using a CDN) interacts with your load balancing strategy and how you can optimize caching behavior during such a surge to offload origin servers.\n*   **Monitoring and Alerting:** What key metrics should you monitor to proactively detect and respond to similar events in the future? How would you set up alerting to trigger automated scaling and rerouting?",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "How would your strategy differ if the spike in viewership was highly localized within a specific ISP's network in Singapore?",
        "What are the security implications of rerouting traffic across regions, and how would you mitigate them?",
        "Assume that your infrastructure has a limited budget. How would you prioritize your efforts in the short term to improve resilience under this high load condition?"

      "feedback": "The candidate responded \"don't know,\" indicating a lack of knowledge on the subject matter. The answer fails to address any aspect of the question, demonstrating no understanding of load balancing strategies, dynamic capacity management, traffic rerouting, failure domain isolation, CDN integration, or monitoring and alerting in the context of a globally distributed video streaming service. There's no evidence of knowledge regarding infrastructure-as-code (IaC) principles, auto-scaling policies, data residency requirements, health checks, circuit breakers, throttling mechanisms, or optimizing caching behavior.",
