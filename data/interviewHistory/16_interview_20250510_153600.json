      "content": "A web application is experiencing slow loading times for users connecting from a specific geographical region. You suspect the issue might be related to the application protocol (HTTP/HTTPS). Briefly describe how you would use common browser developer tools to investigate if HTTP headers are contributing to the slow performance, specifically focusing on identifying large header sizes or inefficient caching directives.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "Besides header size, what other common issues with HTTP/HTTPS configuration might contribute to slow page loading times?",
        "How could you use `curl` or a similar command-line tool to examine the HTTP headers returned by the web server?"
      ],
      "evaluation_points": [
        "Understanding of HTTP headers and their role in web performance.",
        "Ability to use browser developer tools (Network tab) to inspect HTTP requests and responses.",

        "Study the HTTP protocol and its various headers (e.g., Content-Length, Cache-Control, Expires, Content-Encoding).",
        "Practice using browser developer tools (Chrome DevTools, Firefox Developer Tools) to inspect network traffic and analyze HTTP requests and responses. Pay close attention to the size of headers, caching policies, and the use of compression.",
        "Read articles and tutorials on web performance optimization techniques related to HTTP headers and caching.",
