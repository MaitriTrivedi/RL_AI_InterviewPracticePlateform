    "answer": "The primary role of a **file system** in an operating system is to **organize, store, and manage data** on storage devices like hard drives, SSDs, or USB flash drives. It provides a way for the operating system and users to store, retrieve, and manage files efficiently, ensuring that data is not lost, corrupted, and is accessible when needed.\n\n### Key Functions of a File System:\n\n1. **Data Storage**: The file system manages how data is stored on the disk, determining where to place files and how to organize them into directories or folders.\n2. **File Naming and Organization**: It allows users to give files meaningful names (like `report.pdf` or `vacation_photo.jpg`) and organizes them in hierarchical structures (directories and subdirectories) for easy navigation.\n3. **Metadata Management**: The file system keeps track of important information about each file, such as its size, creation date, last modified date, permissions, and location on the storage device.\n4. **Access Control**: It ensures that only authorized users can access, modify, or delete files based on permissions (read, write, execute).\n5. **File Retrieval**: It provides a way to locate files quickly, enabling efficient searches and access by the operating system or user.\n\n### Simple Example in Daily Life:\n\nImagine you\u2019re working on your computer, and you save a new document you\u2019re creating. The file system plays a crucial role in making sure that:\n\n* The document is saved to a specific location (such as `Documents/Work/Report.docx`).\n* The file is named \"Report.docx\" and the file system makes sure it doesn't overwrite an existing file unless you specify otherwise.\n* When you want to open that document later, you can quickly find it because the file system organizes it in a logical way inside the \"Documents\" folder, under the \"Work\" subfolder.\n* The file system also tracks when the file was last modified, so if you need to check the most recent version, the file system helps you identify it.\n\nWithout a file system, you'd be left with a random collection of data on your storage device, with no way to logically organize or retrieve files easily.\n",
    "evaluation": {
      "score": 9,
      "feedback": "The answer is excellent and comprehensively covers the primary role of a file system. It accurately explains the core functions (data storage, naming, metadata, access control, retrieval) and provides a clear, relatable example of daily use. The structure is well-organized with distinct sections for key functions and the practical example. The explanation is easy to understand and free of jargon. A minor improvement could be adding a small sentence on how the file system abstracts the details of physical storage from the user.",

      "areas_for_improvement": [
        "Could explicitly mention the abstraction of physical storage details provided by the file system (although implied, making it explicit strengthens the answer)."

        "Explain different types of file systems (e.g., FAT32, NTFS, ext4) and their characteristics.",
        "Discuss the concept of file system journaling and its importance for data integrity."
