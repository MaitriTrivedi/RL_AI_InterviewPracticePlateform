      "difficulty": 10.0,
      "content": "You are designing a high-throughput, low-latency order processing system for a global e-commerce platform. The system uses a distributed message queue (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ with a robust clustering setup) to handle incoming order requests. Each order must be processed exactly once, and order processing involves multiple independent services (e.g., inventory check, payment authorization, shipping calculation). Due to varying regional regulations and real-time fraud detection algorithms, the processing time for each service can fluctuate significantly. Furthermore, the system needs to be resilient to service failures and network partitions. \n\nDescribe a comprehensive strategy for ensuring exactly-once processing (EOP) of orders, considering the challenges of distributed transactions, fluctuating processing times, and potential network issues. Your strategy should address at least the following aspects:\n\n1.  Message producers and consumers:\n    *   How will producers ensure that messages are reliably published to the queue, even in the face of network errors?\n    *   How will consumers guarantee that they process a message exactly once, even if the consumer crashes after partially processing a message?\n2.  Idempotency:\n    *   How will you design your services to be idempotent, and why is idempotency critical for achieving EOP in this scenario?\n    *   Give specific examples of how idempotency would be implemented in the inventory check and payment authorization services.\n3.  Transaction Management:\n    *   How would you leverage distributed transaction protocols (e.g., two-phase commit (2PC), three-phase commit (3PC), or alternative patterns like Saga) to ensure atomicity across multiple services? What are the trade-offs of each approach in terms of performance, complexity, and fault tolerance?\n    *   If using the Saga pattern, describe a specific implementation strategy, including how compensating transactions will be handled in case of failures at different stages.\n4.  Dead-Letter Queues and Error Handling:\n    *   What mechanisms will be in place to handle messages that cannot be processed due to transient or permanent errors? How will you ensure that these messages are not lost and can be investigated and potentially reprocessed later?\n5.  Monitoring and Observability:\n    *   What key metrics should be monitored to ensure the health and performance of the message queue and the order processing pipeline? How can you use these metrics to detect and diagnose issues proactively?",

        "Consider the case where the message queue itself experiences a catastrophic failure and loses some data. How would you detect and recover from such a scenario, and what impact would it have on order processing?"

      "feedback": "The candidate stated they do not know the answer. This demonstrates a lack of knowledge regarding distributed systems, message queues, and exactly-once processing, which are fundamental concepts for the given scenario. The response fails to address any aspect of the question, indicating a significant gap in understanding the required topics. There's no discussion of idempotency, transaction management, error handling, or monitoring. The lack of any information makes it impossible to assess the candidate's practical application skills or ability to articulate relevant concepts. The answer fails to demonstrate understanding of any of the core concepts and offers no viable solutions to the proposed problem.",
