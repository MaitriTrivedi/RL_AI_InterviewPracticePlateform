    "answer": "A **memory leak** occurs when a program allocates memory for objects or resources but fails to release it when the objects are no longer needed, causing a gradual increase in memory usage. This can lead to performance issues or system crashes. A simple example in Python is when we create a large number of objects and store them in a list without clearing the list afterward. The objects remain in memory because the list still holds references to them, preventing the garbage collector from freeing the memory, even if the objects are no longer needed.\n",

      "feedback": "The answer provides a good definition of a memory leak and its consequences. The Python example is relevant and demonstrates how memory can be held even when objects are no longer explicitly used. The explanation is clear and easy to understand. However, while the Python example is functionally accurate in describing *why* memory is held, it's important to acknowledge that memory leaks in Python are less direct due to the garbage collector and are usually caused by circular references or external resources not being released. It might be beneficial to clarify this nuance. Also, it would be a bit stronger to provide a C++ (or C) example, which is where manual memory management is necessary, making memory leaks more explicit and common.",
