      "difficulty": 2.0,
      "content": "Explain the basic concept of a Min-Heap.  What is the defining property of a Min-Heap, and how does it ensure that the smallest element can be quickly accessed?",
      "follow_up_questions": [

      "score": 1,
      "feedback": "The answer 'cascua' demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of the Min-Heap concept. It provides no relevant information or any attempt to explain the structure or its properties. The response fails to address any aspect of the question, indicating a significant knowledge gap.",

      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Study the definition and properties of a Min-Heap from reliable sources (textbooks, online courses).",
        "Practice drawing Min-Heap structures and inserting/deleting elements to understand how the heap property is maintained.",
        "Review the time complexity of common Min-Heap operations (insertion, deletion, finding minimum).",
        "Compare and contrast Min-Heaps with other heap-based structures like Max-Heaps."
