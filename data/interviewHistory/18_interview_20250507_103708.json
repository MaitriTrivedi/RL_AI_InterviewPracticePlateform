      "difficulty": 3.0,
      "content": "Imagine you are designing a simple system to model a coffee vending machine. What are three key components or entities you would need to represent in your model to simulate its basic functionality, such as dispensing coffee and taking payment?",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "For each component, what is a key attribute you would track or manage in your model?",
        "How would you represent the interaction between the user and the vending machine in your system model?"
      ],
      "evaluation_points": [
        "Representation of physical components (e.g., coffee dispenser, coin acceptor)",
        "Representation of abstract concepts (e.g., user, transaction)",
        "Identification of attributes (e.g., coffee quantity, coin value)"

      "feedback": "The candidate stated they do not know the answer. This indicates a lack of understanding of basic system design principles and object-oriented modeling concepts, which are essential for this type of question. The answer provides no information to assess technical accuracy, completeness, clarity, or practical application.",

      ],
      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Review introductory materials on system design and object-oriented modeling.",
        "Practice breaking down simple real-world scenarios into components and their attributes.",
        "Work through example problems involving modeling systems like vending machines, ATMs, or online stores."
