      "difficulty": 5.446889587418607,
      "content": "You are designing a system for processing different types of media files (images, videos, audio). Each media type requires a specific set of operations for processing, such as compression, resizing, and applying filters. Without writing any code, describe how you would use polymorphism to create a flexible and extensible system that can easily support new media types in the future. Be specific about the classes and methods you would define and how they would interact. Specifically, address how you would handle potential errors during processing, such as a codec not being supported for a particular file type.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "How would you implement a factory pattern in conjunction with your polymorphic approach to instantiate the correct media processor based on the file type?",
        "How would you handle the case where a specific filter is only applicable to a subset of media types? How do you prevent calling an unsupported method on a given media type?"

      "feedback": "The candidate stated \"I don't know\", indicating a complete lack of understanding of the problem and how polymorphism could be applied. No attempt was made to address any aspect of the question, including the core concepts of abstract classes, concrete implementations, or error handling. The answer demonstrates no understanding of object-oriented design principles or their application to media processing.",
