      "content": "You are designing a distributed system for processing financial transactions. You need to support various types of transactions: Stock Trades, Cryptocurrency Transfers, and Foreign Exchange (FX) Swaps. Each transaction type requires different validation rules, security protocols, and data enrichment steps (e.g., retrieving real-time stock quotes for Stock Trades or validating cryptocurrency addresses for Cryptocurrency Transfers). You've chosen an object-oriented approach with inheritance to model these transactions. Implement an abstract `Transaction` class with common attributes like `transactionId`, `amount`, and `timestamp`. Then, create concrete classes `StockTrade`, `CryptoTransfer`, and `FXSwap` that inherit from `Transaction` and implement specific validation, security, and enrichment logic. The system must handle a high volume of transactions concurrently. Consider the following requirements:\n\n1.  **Validation:** Each transaction type has a distinct `validate()` method that must be executed before processing. This method checks for data integrity, regulatory compliance, and sufficient funds (if applicable). Design the inheritance hierarchy so that the `validate()` method is effectively overridden and executed polymorphically.\n2.  **Security:** Each transaction type requires a specific security protocol (e.g., digital signatures, encryption). Implement an abstract `applySecurity()` method in the `Transaction` class, and ensure each derived class applies its appropriate security measures. Address the potential for subtle security vulnerabilities that could arise from improper use of inheritance in this context (e.g., unintended exposure of sensitive data in the base class, incorrect security context switching).\n3.  **Enrichment:** Implement an abstract `enrichData()` method that populates transaction-specific details. For instance, `StockTrade` might retrieve real-time stock quotes, while `CryptoTransfer` validates cryptocurrency addresses. Explore potential challenges with data consistency and atomicity during the enrichment process, given the concurrent nature of the system. Suggest strategies to mitigate these risks.\n4.  **Scalability & Performance:** The system needs to handle millions of transactions per day. Discuss how your inheritance-based design impacts performance and scalability. Identify potential bottlenecks related to polymorphism, object creation, and data access. Suggest optimizations, such as caching, connection pooling, and asynchronous processing, to improve the overall system performance and throughput. Consider alternative designs that may be more performant than a purely inheritance-based approach, and explain their trade-offs.\n5.  **Transaction Retry:** Implement a `retry()` method in the `Transaction` class that handles transaction failures. Account for potential race conditions or duplicated processing if the retry mechanism is not implemented carefully. Ensure that the `retry()` mechanism can handle transient and permanent failures appropriately.",
