      "content": "You are building a simple search engine. A core component is finding documents that contain specific keywords. Given a document (represented as a string) and a list of keywords (also strings), write a function to determine if *all* the keywords are present in the document, regardless of the order they appear. The function should return `True` if all keywords are present, and `False` otherwise. Case should be ignored (e.g., 'The' is the same as 'the').\n\nFor example:\n\ndocument = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy Dog.\"\nkeywords = [\"fox\", \"dog\", \"quick\"]\n\nThe function should return `True`.\n",

      "feedback": "The candidate stated they did not know the answer, indicating a complete lack of solution.
