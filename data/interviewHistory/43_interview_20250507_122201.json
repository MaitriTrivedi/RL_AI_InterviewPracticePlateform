      "content": "You are tasked with designing a system for managing different types of media files (images, videos, and audio) in a library application. Implement a class hierarchy using inheritance to represent these media types. The base class `MediaFile` should contain attributes like `title`, `file_path`, and `file_size`. The subclasses `ImageFile`, `VideoFile`, and `AudioFile` should inherit from `MediaFile` and add specific attributes like `resolution` for `ImageFile`, `duration` and `frame_rate` for `VideoFile`, and `bitrate` and `sample_rate` for `AudioFile`. Implement methods to:\n\n1.  A constructor for each class to initialize the appropriate attributes.\n2.  A `display_info()` method in each class that prints the attributes of the media file in a user-friendly format. This method should leverage polymorphism to provide specific information depending on the media type.\n3.  A method in the `MediaFile` class called `is_large_file(self, size_limit_mb)` which returns True if the file size is greater than the given `size_limit_mb` in megabytes, and False otherwise.\n\nFinally, create a list containing instances of each media file type (ImageFile, VideoFile, and AudioFile) with sample data, and iterate through the list to call the `display_info()` and `is_large_file()` methods for each media file, with a size limit of 100 MB.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "How would you handle adding metadata that is specific to only some media types, and not all (e.g., GPS coordinates for images, actors for videos)? Consider using composition or other design patterns.",
        "How could you implement error handling (e.g., using exception handling) if the provided file path is invalid or the file doesn't exist?",
        "Explain how your design could be extended to support new media types in the future without significantly modifying the existing code. What design principles support this?"

      "feedback": "The student stated they \"don't know\", indicating a complete lack of understanding or inability to implement the requested class hierarchy, methods, and list iteration with polymorphism. There is no code or conceptual understanding demonstrated, therefore the score reflects a complete failure to address the problem.",
