      "subtopic": "Stacks and Queues",
      "difficulty": 8,
      "content": "Design a highly scalable system for processing stock market orders using a combination of Stacks and Queues. Orders arrive at a high rate (millions per second) and need to be processed efficiently. The system must prioritize older orders and also handle cancellations. Specifically:\n\n1.  Orders arrive and are initially placed into a priority queue where priority is determined by arrival time (oldest first). We will call this the `IncomingOrderQueue`. \n2.  From the `IncomingOrderQueue`, orders are moved to a stack-based system for processing. This system attempts to match incoming buy and sell orders. The stack structure, which we will call the `OrderMatchingStack`, represents the current pool of unmatched orders for a particular stock. For simplicity, assume we're dealing with only one stock.\n3.  New orders are pushed onto the `OrderMatchingStack`. If a matching order (e.g., a buy order matching a sell order at the same price) is found at the top of the stack, both orders are removed, and the trade is executed (assume an external execution system). If no match is found, the order remains on the stack.\n4.  Implement a cancellation mechanism. A cancellation request includes the order ID. When a cancellation request arrives, the system needs to efficiently find and remove the corresponding order from either the `IncomingOrderQueue` or the `OrderMatchingStack`. Optimizing cancellation is crucial since numerous cancellations are expected.\n\nAddress the following:\n\n*   What data structures would you use for `IncomingOrderQueue` and `OrderMatchingStack`? Justify your choices, especially considering scalability and thread safety.\n*   How would you implement the cancellation mechanism to ensure efficiency and thread safety? Consider scenarios where the order might be in the queue or the stack.\n*   How would you handle concurrency to allow multiple orders and cancellation requests to be processed simultaneously without data corruption or race conditions?\n*   Describe any optimizations you could apply to improve the performance of the system under extremely high load.",
