      "content": "Imagine you have two simple processes running on the same machine. One process generates log messages, and the other process is responsible for writing these messages to a file. What is a simple and common IPC mechanism you could use to pass these log messages from the generator process to the file-writing process?",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "What are the advantages and disadvantages of your chosen method in this scenario?",

      "feedback": "The answer correctly identifies a message queue as a viable IPC mechanism and provides a working Python implementation using threads to simulate processes. The code demonstrates the basic principles of using a queue for inter-process communication. However, the question specifically asks about *processes*, and the provided solution uses *threads*. While threads can be used to simulate concurrent execution, they operate within the same memory space and are not a true representation of separate processes. The answer also doesn't explicitly discuss potential issues like blocking and buffer size limitations, although the code implicitly handles blocking with `log_queue.get()`. A better answer would address the fact that the code provided uses threads instead of processes, and discuss more suitable IPC mechanisms like pipes or system message queues when dealing with separate processes.",

        "Correctly identifies message queues as a suitable IPC mechanism.",

        "Uses threads instead of processes to simulate separate execution environments.",
        "Does not explicitly discuss the limitations of the chosen IPC mechanism (e.g., buffering, blocking).",
        "Does not mention alternative IPC mechanisms like pipes which might be more straightforward for this specific scenario."
      ],
      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Explain the difference between threads and processes and how that impacts IPC choices.",
        "Discuss alternative IPC mechanisms that are more suitable for separate processes, such as pipes or system message queues (e.g., using the `multiprocessing` library in Python).",
        "Describe how to handle potential blocking scenarios and manage buffer sizes in a real-world implementation."
