      "subtopic": "Two Pointer",
      "difficulty": 3.0,
      "content": "You are given a sorted array of integers called `numbers`. You need to find if there exist two numbers in the array that add up to a specific target value `target`. Implement a function `has_sum(numbers, target)` that returns `true` if such a pair exists, and `false` otherwise, using the Two Pointer approach. For example, if `numbers = [2, 7, 11, 15]` and `target = 9`, the function should return `true` because `2 + 7 = 9`.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "What is the time complexity of your solution?",

    "evaluation": {
      "score": 10,
      "feedback": "The solution is excellent and demonstrates a strong understanding of the Two Pointer approach. The code is technically accurate, complete, and easy to understand. The initialization of pointers, the movement of pointers based on the comparison with the target, and the handling of the case where no pair exists are all correctly implemented. The comments further enhance the clarity of the code.",
      "strengths": [
        "Correctly implements the Two Pointer approach.",
        "Clear and concise code.",
        "Handles all cases effectively (pair found, pair not found).",
        "Efficiently utilizes the sorted property of the array."

      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Consider how this approach would be affected by duplicate numbers in the input array. How would you handle the requirement of finding *all* pairs that sum to the target?",
        "Explore how this technique can be applied to other problems involving sorted arrays, such as finding triplets that sum to a target value."
