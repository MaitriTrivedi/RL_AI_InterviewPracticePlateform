      "difficulty": 6.9784379022609615,
      "content": "Imagine you're designing a system for optimizing cloud resource allocation across multiple virtual machines (VMs) to minimize operational costs. You have a set of `N` VMs, each with a known CPU usage demand (`cpu_demand_i`) and memory usage demand (`memory_demand_i`). You also have a pool of `M` physical servers, each with a known CPU capacity (`cpu_capacity_j`) and memory capacity (`memory_capacity_j`). Your goal is to allocate each VM to exactly one server such that no server's CPU or memory capacity is exceeded, and the total cost is minimized.  The cost of using a server is not fixed but depends on the utilization of the server: `cost_j = base_cost_j * (cpu_utilization_j + memory_utilization_j) / 2`, where `cpu_utilization_j` is the total CPU demand of VMs allocated to server `j` divided by `cpu_capacity_j` and similarly for memory.  `base_cost_j` is the inherent cost of the server before any VMs are allocated to it.  Design a greedy algorithm to solve this resource allocation problem. Consider the following constraints:\n\n*   The number of VMs (`N`) and servers (`M`) can be in the thousands.\n*   Finding the absolute optimal solution is computationally expensive.  Focus on a practical, efficient approach.  \n*   The algorithm needs to be adaptable if new VMs arrive or existing VMs depart dynamically, requiring reallocation.\n\nDescribe your algorithm, including its time complexity. Discuss how you would handle potential edge cases, such as when a VM's resource demand exceeds the capacity of any single server.  Also, discuss optimization strategies to improve the algorithm's performance for large-scale deployments and dynamic reallocation scenarios.",

        "How would you modify your algorithm if certain VMs have affinity requirements (i.e., they must be placed on specific server types or in a certain geographic location)?",
        "What are the limitations of your greedy approach compared to other optimization techniques like integer programming?  Under what conditions would the greedy solution be significantly suboptimal?",

      "feedback": "The answer provided was \"don't know the answer.\" This indicates a complete lack of engagement with the problem and no attempt to formulate a solution, even at a high level. Therefore, it receives a score of 0. The question required designing a greedy algorithm for resource allocation, considering constraints, cost function optimization, time complexity, edge cases, and dynamic reallocation. None of these aspects were addressed.",
