      "difficulty": 6.401044808613081,
      "content": "You are building a multi-threaded server application using sockets in a resource-constrained environment (e.g., an embedded system or a cloud server with limited resources). This server needs to handle a large number of concurrent client connections, each potentially sending small bursts of data. Traditional blocking socket operations can lead to thread blocking and significant overhead in context switching, potentially exhausting available resources. Describe how you would optimize your socket programming implementation to minimize resource consumption and maximize the number of concurrent client connections the server can handle. Focus on the specific socket options, techniques, and strategies you would employ. Consider alternatives to thread-per-connection, like event-driven architectures using `select`, `poll`, or `epoll`.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "What are the trade-offs between using `select`, `poll`, and `epoll`, especially in terms of performance and scalability?",
        "How would you implement flow control to prevent a fast client from overwhelming the server, given the limited resource constraints?",
        "How would you handle connection errors and disconnections gracefully to prevent resource leaks?"

      "feedback": "The candidate stated they don't know the answer, indicating a complete lack of understanding of the core concepts required to address the problem. They didn't demonstrate any familiarity with non-blocking socket operations, I/O multiplexing, or resource management techniques essential for building high-concurrency servers. This response shows no understanding of the problem or possible solutions.",

        "Study non-blocking socket programming in C or a similar language, focusing on how to configure sockets for non-blocking operation.",
