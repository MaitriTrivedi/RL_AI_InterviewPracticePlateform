      "difficulty": 3.0,
      "content": "Imagine you are working in a snack vending machine company. The vending machine needs to give the minimum number of coins as change. You are given an array of coin denominations `coins = [1, 5, 10, 25]` representing 1 cent, 5 cents, 10 cents, and 25 cents, respectively. You are also given an amount `amount` (in cents) to provide as change. \n\nWrite a function `minCoins(coins, amount)` that returns the minimum number of coins needed to make change for the given `amount`. You can assume that you have an infinite supply of each coin denomination. For example, if amount is 41, the minimum coins would be 1 quarter, 1 dime, 1 nickel, and 1 penny for a total of 4 coins. If it is not possible to make the exact change return -1.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "Why does a greedy approach work in this specific coin denomination set? Are there coin sets where a greedy approach would fail?",
        "How would you handle invalid input such as a negative `amount`?",
        "What is the time complexity of your solution?"
      ],
      "evaluation_points": [
        "Greedy approach: Start with the largest coin denomination and repeatedly subtract it from the amount until the amount is zero or can't be reduced with that denomination.",
        "Iterate through the coin denominations in descending order.",
        "Handle the case where the amount cannot be made with the given coin denominations (return -1)."
      ],

    },
    "answer": "def minCoins(coins, amount):\n    # Initialize a DP array with a large value\n    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)\n    dp[0] = 0  # No coins needed for 0 amount\n\n    # Loop through each coin\n    for coin in coins:\n        for i in range(coin, amount + 1):\n            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)\n\n    # If dp[amount] is still infinity, return -1 (not possible)\n    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1\n",
    "evaluation": {
      "score": 7,
      "feedback": "The solution uses dynamic programming which is correct but not the optimal approach for the given set of coins. The question was specifically designed to be solved using a greedy approach. While the code does produce the correct output, it is less efficient than the greedy approach and doesn't demonstrate the understanding of when a greedy algorithm is appropriate. The code is also well-structured and readable. The DP approach initializes a DP table, iterates through coins and amounts, and correctly updates the DP table to find the minimum number of coins.",
      "strengths": [
        "Correctly solves the problem using dynamic programming.",
        "Code is well-structured and easy to understand.",
        "Handles the case where a solution is not possible by returning -1."

      "areas_for_improvement": [
        "Does not use the greedy approach, which is the intended and more efficient solution for the given coin denominations.",
        "Doesn't explain why the DP approach was chosen over a greedy approach."
      ],
      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Explain why the greedy approach is optimal for US coin denominations and then implement the greedy algorithm.",
        "Compare the time complexity of the DP and greedy approaches for this problem."
