      "topic": "system_design",
      "subtopic": "Rate Limiting",
      "difficulty": 4.6,
      "content": "You are designing a rate limiter for a public API that allows users to upload images. You want to limit each user to 10 image uploads per minute to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage. You've chosen a token bucket algorithm. Describe how you would implement this rate limiter in a single server environment using an in-memory data structure like a dictionary. Focus on the core logic of how the tokens are added and consumed and how you would determine if a user has exceeded their limit. What are the potential drawbacks of this single-server solution?",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "How would you handle a situation where a user attempts to upload an image larger than the allocated token size (e.g., they try to upload 2 images simultaneously, effectively consuming 2 tokens at once)?",
        "What are some strategies to handle rate limiting errors gracefully for the user (e.g., what kind of error message should be returned)?"
