    "answer": "A **Min-Heap** and a **Max-Heap** are both types of binary heaps, which are specialized binary trees that maintain a specific order property for efficient operations like insertion, deletion, and finding the minimum or maximum element.\n\n* In a **Min-Heap**, the value of each node is less than or equal to the values of its children. This ensures that the smallest element is always at the root. Operations like extracting the minimum element are efficient because the smallest element is always readily available at the top.\n\n* In a **Max-Heap**, the value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of its children. This ensures that the largest element is always at the root, and extracting the maximum element becomes efficient.\n\n### Real-World Example:\n\nImagine you're managing a **task scheduling system** where you need to execute tasks based on their deadlines (with earlier deadlines having higher priority). In this case, a **Min-Heap** is more efficient because it allows you to quickly access and remove the task with the earliest deadline, ensuring that you execute tasks in the correct order.\n\nFor example, if tasks have deadlines as timestamps (like 10:00 AM, 10:30 AM, 11:00 AM), the Min-Heap would always keep the earliest deadline at the root, making it easy to schedule the next task. A **Max-Heap** wouldn't be as efficient for this scenario, because it would keep the latest deadline at the root, forcing you to sift through the heap to find the task with the earliest deadline.\n",

      "score": 9,
      "feedback": "The answer is excellent. It clearly explains the difference between Min-Heaps and Max-Heaps, accurately describing their properties and root element characteristics. The real-world example of a task scheduling system is also well-chosen and explains why a Min-Heap would be more efficient in that scenario. The explanation is easy to understand and concise.",

        "While the example is good, mentioning how the heap operations (insert, extractMin) contribute to the overall efficiency in the scheduling system would further strengthen the explanation.",

        "What are the time complexities of the basic operations (insert, extractMin/Max) for both Min-Heaps and Max-Heaps?",
