    "answer": "To extract the filename from a given file path, we can use Python's built-in `os.path.basename()` function, which is specifically designed to extract the last component of a path (i.e., the filename). We will also implement a custom function to handle relative paths and filenames directly.\n\n### Python Code Implementation:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\ndef extract_filename(path):\n    return os.path.basename(path)\n\n# Example usage\nprint(extract_filename(\"/home/user/documents/report.txt\"))  # Output: report.txt\nprint(extract_filename(\"documents/report.txt\"))            # Output: report.txt\nprint(extract_filename(\"report.txt\"))                       # Output: report.txt\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **`os.path.basename(path)`**:\n\n   * This function returns the last part of the path, which in this case is the filename. Whether the input is an absolute path (`/home/user/documents/report.txt`), a relative path (`documents/report.txt`), or just the filename (`report.txt`), `basename()` extracts the part after the last `/`.\n2. **Custom Solution**:\n\n   * If you wanted to implement this without `os.path`, you could split the string by `/` and take the last element, but using `os.path.basename()` is cleaner and platform-independent.\n\n### Time Complexity:\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where **n** is the length of the input path string. The function must traverse the path string to locate the last directory separator (`/`) and return everything after it. Since this involves a single pass through the string, the complexity is linear.\n",

      "feedback": "The solution correctly uses `os.path.basename()` to extract the filename, which is a good and efficient approach. The code is clean, easy to understand, and handles the provided test cases. The explanation is also well-written. However, while the time complexity is *technically* O(n) for `os.path.basename()`, it's misleading to state this as the primary driver of complexity in most practical scenarios. `os.path.basename()` often relies on underlying operating system calls which can have optimized implementations that might perform better than a naive O(n) string traversal in many cases. The description could be more nuanced and acknowledge that the OS level implementation might make this function much faster in practice. Although the question does not explicitly ask to avoid standard library, a more rigorous answer could provide an implementation without the `os` library to showcase string manipulation skills.",
