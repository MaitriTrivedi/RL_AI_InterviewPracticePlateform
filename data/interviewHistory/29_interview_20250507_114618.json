    "answer": "A **Greedy algorithm** is an approach for solving optimization problems by making the locally optimal choice at each step, with the hope of finding the global optimum. It does not reconsider its choices, even if better solutions may exist later.\n\n### Practical Applications:\n1. **Activity Selection**: Scheduling tasks to maximize the number of activities completed, such as selecting non-overlapping meetings.\n2. **Huffman Coding**: Efficiently encoding data for compression (like in ZIP files).\n3. **Knapsack Problem (Greedy Approximation)**: Selecting items with the highest value-to-weight ratio to maximize value.\n4. **Dijkstra\u2019s Algorithm**: Finding the shortest path in a graph (with positive weights).\n5. **Fractional Knapsack**: Picking portions of items to maximize value in a knapsack problem where fractions of items can be taken.\n\nGreedy algorithms are efficient but don\u2019t always guarantee the best solution for all problems (e.g., in the 0/1 Knapsack problem).",

      "feedback": "The answer provides a good overview of the Greedy algorithm, its practical applications, and limitations. The explanation is clear and concise. The identified applications are relevant and well-known. However, the answer lacks a discussion of common challenges faced when designing and implementing greedy algorithms, such as proving the optimality of a greedy choice and handling edge cases. It also could benefit from explaining why Greedy doesn't always work by providing specific examples or conditions where it fails.",
