      "difficulty": 3.4499999999999997,
      "content": "Imagine you are designing a simple social media platform where users can post updates and follow each other. Given CAP Theorem, how would you prioritize consistency vs. availability when a user attempts to post a new update, considering that network partitions are possible (e.g., a server goes down, or network connectivity is lost)? What are the trade-offs of choosing strong consistency versus high availability in this specific scenario?",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "What strategies could you use to mitigate the impact of prioritizing availability on data consistency in the short term (e.g., eventual consistency)?",
        "How might your choice of consistency vs. availability change if, instead of user posts, we were dealing with financial transactions (e.g., transferring funds between accounts)?"
      ],
      "evaluation_points": [
        "Understanding of CAP Theorem and its three properties: Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance.",
        "Ability to articulate the trade-offs between consistency and availability in the context of a real-world application.",
