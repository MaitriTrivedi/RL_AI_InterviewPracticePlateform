      "subtopic": "Basic SQL",
      "difficulty": 4.7,
      "content": "You have a database table named `orders` that stores customer order information. The table has the following columns: `order_id` (INT, Primary Key), `customer_id` (INT), `order_date` (DATE), `total_amount` (DECIMAL), and `status` (VARCHAR). You need to identify customers who have placed multiple orders (more than 1) in the last 30 days and whose total spending across all those orders exceeds $100. Write a SQL query to retrieve the `customer_id` and their total spending for these customers. The result should only include the customer_id and the sum of their total_amount for those customers who meet the specified criteria.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "How would you handle potential NULL values in the `total_amount` column?",
        "Can you explain how the `GROUP BY` clause works in this query?",
        "How would you modify the query if you needed to include the number of orders each qualifying customer placed?"
      ],
      "evaluation_points": [
        "Using `GROUP BY` to aggregate orders by customer.",
        "Using `COUNT()` and `SUM()` aggregate functions correctly.",
        "Using `HAVING` clause to filter aggregated results.",
        "Filtering orders within the last 30 days using `order_date`.",
        "Calculating date difference appropriately (e.g., using `DATE_SUB` or similar function depending on the specific SQL dialect)."

      "feedback": "The answer provided was 'don't know the asnwer'. This indicates a complete lack of understanding and inability to address the problem. No SQL concepts are demonstrated, and the solution is entirely missing. The student needs a foundational understanding of SQL, including aggregate functions, date filtering, and grouping.",

      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Review basic SQL tutorials focusing on SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, and aggregate functions.",
        "Practice writing SQL queries to solve similar problems involving filtering, aggregation, and date calculations.",
        "Study examples of SQL queries that use `DATE_SUB` (or the equivalent function in your preferred SQL dialect) to filter data based on date ranges."
