      "content": "Imagine you are building a simple spell checker. You have a dictionary of valid words stored in a list. Given an input word, determine if it's a valid word by checking if it exists in the dictionary.  Implement a function that efficiently checks if a given word is present in the dictionary, taking advantage of hashing. Analyze the time complexity of your approach. Assume you're using Python and can use built-in data structures.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a hash set (like Python's `set`) for this task compared to iterating through the list directly?",
