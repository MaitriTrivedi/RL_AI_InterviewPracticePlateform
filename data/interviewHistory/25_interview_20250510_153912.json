      "content": "Imagine you are designing a system to model a simple vending machine. This machine dispenses items like soda, chips, and candy. Using state diagrams, describe the states the vending machine can be in and the transitions between those states. Include at least four states and three transitions. Focus on the core functionality like accepting money, selecting an item, and dispensing the item. Assume the machine initially has sufficient inventory.",

    "answer": "To model a simple vending machine using a state diagram, we can represent the system with the following states and transitions. The vending machine has four core states, and transitions between them reflect the machine\u2019s primary functionality: accepting money, selecting an item, and dispensing the item.\n\nStates:\nIdle: This is the initial state where the machine is waiting for user input. It is ready to accept money and awaits a selection.\n\nMoney Inserted: This state occurs when the user inserts money into the machine, but has not yet made a selection. The machine recognizes that money has been added, but the user still needs to choose an item.\n\nItem Selected: This state is entered after the user selects an item from the available options. The machine now checks if there is enough money and inventory to proceed with the selection.\n\nDispensing Item: This state represents the machine dispensing the selected item to the user. After this action, the machine returns to the Idle state, ready for the next transaction.\n\nTransitions:\nIdle \u2192 Money Inserted:\n\nCondition: The user inserts money into the machine.\n\nAction: The machine transitions from the Idle state to the Money Inserted state.\n\nMoney Inserted \u2192 Item Selected:\n\nCondition: The user selects an item (e.g., presses a button for soda, chips, or candy).\n\nAction: The machine checks if the amount of money inserted is sufficient for the selected item. If so, the machine transitions from the Money Inserted state to the Item Selected state.\n\nItem Selected \u2192 Dispensing Item:\n\nCondition: The item is available, and the user has inserted enough money.\n\nAction: The machine dispenses the selected item and moves to the Dispensing Item state.\n\nDispensing Item \u2192 Idle:\n\nCondition: The item has been dispensed, and the transaction is complete.\n\nAction: The machine returns to the Idle state, ready for the next customer.",

      "feedback": "The answer provides a good foundation for modeling the vending machine's behavior using a state diagram. The core states (Idle, Money Inserted, Item Selected, Dispensing Item) are clearly identified and relevant to the problem. The transitions between these states are also logically sound and accurately reflect the flow of a typical vending machine transaction. The descriptions of the conditions and actions for each transition are well-articulated. However, the answer could be improved by considering error scenarios or edge cases. For instance, what happens if the user doesn't insert enough money, or if the selected item is out of stock? Including these scenarios would demonstrate a more thorough understanding of state machine design and its application in real-world systems.",

        "How would you incorporate error handling (e.g., insufficient funds, item out of stock) into the state diagram?",
        "Explain how you would handle the dispensing of change back to the user.",
        "Consider adding a 'Change Due' state to handle return of change."
