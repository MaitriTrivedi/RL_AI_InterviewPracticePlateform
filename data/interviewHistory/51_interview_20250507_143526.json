      "difficulty": 9.232631258050613,
      "content": "Consider a high-performance computing (HPC) system running a large-scale, distributed scientific simulation. This simulation involves thousands of processes spread across multiple compute nodes, communicating via MPI. Due to unforeseen circumstances (e.g., network instability, hardware fault), a subset of these nodes experiences transient network partitioning, causing some processes to temporarily lose connectivity with the rest of the simulation. These processes continue to execute locally, unaware of the network failure. Assume you cannot modify the simulation code itself. Design a robust process management strategy (including fault detection, recovery, and process state handling) that minimizes data loss, avoids indefinite blocking (deadlock) upon network recovery, and ensures eventual consistency of the global simulation state when the network partition heals. Specifically address the challenges of maintaining checkpoint consistency across the partitioned processes and the strategy for reintegrating the partitioned processes into the running simulation after the network heals, while avoiding data corruption and ensuring overall simulation integrity.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "How would your strategy handle the scenario where a process within a partition *commits* a partial result based on local state, while the rest of the system has progressed beyond that state before the partition heals?",
        "What modifications to your process management strategy would be necessary if the transient network partitions were *correlated*, meaning that certain nodes are more likely to experience network issues simultaneously?",
        "How would you estimate the overhead (performance impact) of your fault-tolerance mechanisms, and how would you optimize them to minimize this overhead while maintaining the desired level of resilience?"

      "feedback": "The candidate stated that they do not know the answer. This demonstrates honesty, but provides no insight into their understanding of HPC, distributed systems, fault tolerance, or MPI. A score of 1 is given to acknowledge the honesty, but the lack of any substance warrants a very low score.",
