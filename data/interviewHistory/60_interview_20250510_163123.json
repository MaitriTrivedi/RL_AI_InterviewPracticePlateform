      "difficulty": 7.5,
      "content": "You are building a real-time anomaly detection system that processes streaming data. One component involves continuously tracking the median of the last 'N' data points (a sliding window). Implement a solution that efficiently calculates the median of this sliding window using two heaps: a max-heap to store the smaller half of the numbers and a min-heap to store the larger half. Assume that the 'N' data points are continuously updating. Consider the following requirements:\n\n1.  The solution must be efficient, maintaining a time complexity of O(log N) for each update (addition/removal of data points) to the sliding window.\n2.  The solution needs to handle the edge case where 'N' is very large (e.g., 1 billion) and memory usage becomes a constraint. Describe how you would optimize the heap data structures to minimize memory footprint without significantly impacting performance.\n3. When a new data point arrives and the sliding window is full, the oldest data point needs to be removed. Efficiently handling duplicate values within the sliding window is crucial to ensure the correct median calculation. Design a robust mechanism to handle duplicate values correctly without resorting to linear search within the heaps to remove the old data point.\n",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "How would you handle the scenario where the incoming data stream is temporarily paused or stalled? How does your solution ensure the median calculation remains accurate when the stream resumes?",
        "What are the trade-offs between memory usage and performance when choosing different heap implementations (e.g., binary heap, binomial heap, Fibonacci heap) in this scenario? Which implementation would be most suitable, and why?",
        "How would you adapt your solution to calculate other percentiles (e.g., 25th, 75th) of the sliding window in addition to the median?"
