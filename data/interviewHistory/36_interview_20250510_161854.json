      "difficulty": 6.0,
      "content": "You are building a system that processes incoming image files. Each image needs to undergo two separate and independent operations: 1) resizing and 2) applying a watermark. Currently, these operations are performed sequentially for each image, resulting in slow processing times, especially when dealing with a large number of images.\n\nRefactor the provided (pseudo) code below to utilize multithreading to improve the processing speed. Specifically, design and implement a solution where the resizing and watermarking operations happen concurrently for each image. Consider using a thread pool to manage the threads efficiently.\n\n```python\ndef process_image(image_path):\n resized_image = resize_image(image_path) # Time consuming\n watermarked_image = apply_watermark(resized_image) # Time consuming\n save_image(watermarked_image)\n\n\nimage_paths = [\"image1.jpg\", \"image2.png\", \"image3.jpeg\", ...]\n\nfor image_path in image_paths:\n process_image(image_path)\n\n```\n\nFocus on demonstrating how you would implement the threading logic and handle potential issues such as race conditions (if any are relevant in your design), and efficiently managing a thread pool. You don't need to implement the `resize_image`, `apply_watermark`, or `save_image` functions themselves, just assume they exist and take a file path or image object as input.",

    "answer": "To improve the processing speed of images, we can use **multithreading** to perform the resizing and watermarking operations concurrently. Each image is processed in two steps: first, the image is resized, and then the watermark is applied. We can leverage a **ThreadPoolExecutor** to manage the threads efficiently, submitting each operation as a separate task (resizing and watermarking) for concurrent execution. This allows both operations to run in parallel, reducing the overall processing time for each image.\n\nUsing a thread pool ensures efficient resource management, avoiding the overhead of creating and destroying threads for each image. The **future** objects allow us to synchronize tasks, ensuring that the resizing operation completes before starting the watermarking process. This approach significantly improves processing time, especially when handling a large number of images, while maintaining thread safety without the need for additional synchronization mechanisms.\n\n",

      "feedback": "The response correctly identifies the potential benefits of multithreading and the use of a `ThreadPoolExecutor`. However, it lacks a concrete code implementation, only providing a high-level description. The response doesn't fully address how the two operations (resizing and watermarking) would be correctly submitted and synchronized using futures to ensure the watermarking operation relies on the output of the resizing operation. Furthermore, there's no mention of error handling or how the results would be saved after both operations are complete. The answer mentions thread safety but does not demonstrate any code to show how it is achieved, although in this specific scenario with operations on different images there are no race conditions. It also does not demonstrate how to deal with the output of resize_image being passed to apply_watermark within the thread pool context. The explanation around 'future' objects is misleading because it suggests synchronization between the two functions. Synchronization is inherent, in the sense the apply watermark future needs to depend on the resize future, but the answer is missing implementation detail. It only provided a high level abstract response.",
