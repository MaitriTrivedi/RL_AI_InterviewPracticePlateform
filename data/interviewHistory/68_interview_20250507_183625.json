      "difficulty": 4.748138795971096,
      "content": "Imagine you are designing a file transfer protocol that needs to reliably transfer large files over a network with varying congestion levels. The protocol initially uses TCP Reno. However, you observe significant performance degradation (low throughput, high packet loss) during periods of high network congestion. How would you diagnose whether TCP Reno's congestion control mechanism is the primary cause of this performance issue, and what alternative congestion control algorithms might you consider to improve performance under these conditions? Explain your reasoning for choosing these alternatives, and what specific metrics you would monitor to evaluate their effectiveness.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "What are the limitations of TCP Reno that make it susceptible to performance issues during high congestion?",
        "How does TCP Cubic differ from TCP Reno, and why might it be a better choice in high bandwidth networks?"

      "evaluation_points": [
        "Understanding of TCP Reno's congestion control mechanisms (slow start, congestion avoidance, fast retransmit/recovery)",
        "Identification of Reno's limitations, especially 'sawtooth' behavior and fairness issues with newer congestion control algorithms",
        "Knowledge of alternative congestion control algorithms (e.g., Cubic, BBR) and their strengths/weaknesses",
        "Ability to suggest relevant metrics for evaluation (e.g., throughput, packet loss, round-trip time, fairness)",
        "Ability to explain diagnostic methods such as packet capture analysis (e.g., using Wireshark) or network monitoring tools to assess congestion"

      "feedback": "The candidate explicitly stated that they do not know the answer. This demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of the topic, encompassing congestion control mechanisms, alternative algorithms, and diagnostic techniques. A complete understanding of the underlying principles and practical applications is missing. Consequently, the response fails to address any aspect of the question.",

        "Study the TCP Reno congestion control algorithm in detail, focusing on its phases (slow start, congestion avoidance, fast retransmit, fast recovery) and limitations under high congestion.",
