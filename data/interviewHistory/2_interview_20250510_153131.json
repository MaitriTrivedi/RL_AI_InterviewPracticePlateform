    "answer": "The **Greedy algorithm** is a problem-solving approach that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the option that offers the most immediate benefit or seems best at the moment. It doesn't reconsider its choices, which makes it fast and efficient, but it may not always lead to the globally optimal solution. Greedy algorithms are often used when a problem exhibits the **greedy-choice property** (a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by choosing the locally optimal choices) and **optimal substructure** (a problem's optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems).\n\nIn practice, greedy algorithms are widely used in scenarios such as **Huffman coding** for data compression, **Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm** for finding the shortest path in a graph, and **Kruskal\u2019s and Prim\u2019s algorithms** for finding a minimum spanning tree. They're also used in **activity selection problems**, **coin change (with certain denominations)**, and **scheduling tasks** to maximize efficiency or profit. Although not always perfect, greedy algorithms provide a fast and often good-enough solution for many real-world problems.\n",

      "feedback": "The answer provides a solid overview of the greedy algorithm. It correctly defines the core concept, mentions the greedy-choice property and optimal substructure (although a deeper explanation would be beneficial), and provides several relevant examples. The response also acknowledges the algorithm's limitations. To further improve, the answer could delve into some of the challenges associated with greedy algorithms, such as proving their correctness or recognizing when a greedy approach is not suitable. Including a brief discussion of scenarios where a greedy algorithm fails (and why) would strengthen the response. More elaboration on why each practical application is considered a greedy algorithm would also be helpful.",
