      "difficulty": 10.0,
      "content": "Consider a globally distributed e-commerce platform with a multi-region database setup (e.g., using CockroachDB or Google Cloud Spanner) and serving millions of requests per second. The product catalog, represented by a large `Products` table, is sharded across multiple regions based on product category to optimize for regional demand. Each region has a local `Orders` table. There is a global `Users` table replicated across all regions. A key business requirement is to provide real-time personalized recommendations for each user based on their past order history. This requires joining the `Users`, `Orders`, and `Products` tables. Describe a comprehensive query optimization strategy that minimizes latency and maximizes throughput for this recommendation query, considering the challenges of data locality, network latency, eventual consistency (if applicable), and high concurrency. Your solution should address query rewriting techniques, distributed query planning, data partitioning strategies (beyond the initial product category sharding), caching mechanisms, and potential use of approximate query processing. Also, outline a monitoring and alerting strategy to proactively identify and address query performance degradation in this distributed environment.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "How would your solution change if the data volume in the `Orders` table doubles within a year?",
        "What are the trade-offs between strong consistency and eventual consistency in this scenario, and how would each choice impact query performance and data accuracy?",
        "How would you handle 'hot' product categories that experience disproportionately high request rates, potentially overloading a single shard? Consider both read and write scenarios."

      "feedback": "The candidate responded with \"don't know\", indicating a complete lack of knowledge regarding distributed query optimization strategies in a multi-region database environment. This demonstrates a significant gap in understanding key concepts related to distributed systems, database design, and performance optimization. The answer does not address any aspect of the question, including data locality, network latency, eventual consistency, high concurrency, query rewriting, distributed query planning, data partitioning, caching, approximate query processing, monitoring, or alerting.",
