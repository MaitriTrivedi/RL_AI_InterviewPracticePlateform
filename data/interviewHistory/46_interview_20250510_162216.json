      "difficulty": 1.9166666666666663,
      "content": "Imagine you're designing a very simple system for a library to keep track of books. Name two core entities (objects or concepts) you would model in this system and briefly describe what attributes (properties or characteristics) each entity might have.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "Why did you choose those particular entities?",
        "Can you give a real-world example of one piece of data (attribute) associated with one of the entities you mentioned?"
      ],
      "evaluation_points": [
        "Identification of relevant entities (e.g., Book, Member).",

      "feedback": "The candidate provided 'do not know' as their answer, indicating a lack of understanding of basic object-oriented modeling concepts. There is no evidence of any attempt to identify entities or their attributes relevant to a library system.",

        "Review basic object-oriented programming concepts, focusing on entities, classes, and attributes.",
        "Practice identifying entities and their attributes in simple real-world scenarios (e.g., a school, a store, a restaurant)."
