      "content": "Imagine you are designing a system for processing financial transactions. You have multiple data sources providing transaction data (e.g., a database, a message queue, a REST API). Each data source returns transaction data in a slightly different format. To create a flexible and maintainable system, you decide to use an interface, `ITransactionSource`, to define a common contract for retrieving transaction data. The `ITransactionSource` interface has a method `GetTransactions()` which returns a collection of `Transaction` objects. \n\nHowever, some of these data sources might be slow or unreliable, potentially impacting the overall system performance. How would you implement `ITransactionSource` to handle potential errors (e.g., timeout, network failure) when retrieving transactions from different sources, ensuring that the system remains resilient and provides informative error messages to the user or logs?",

    "answer": "To design a robust and resilient system for processing financial transactions from multiple data sources, you can implement the `ITransactionSource` interface in a way that gracefully handles potential errors (like timeouts, network failures, etc.) and ensures that the system remains performant and reliable. Here's how we can approach this:\n\n### Design Considerations:\n\n1. **Resilience**: We need to ensure that even if one data source fails or is slow, the system can still retrieve data from other sources or at least handle the failure gracefully.\n2. **Error Handling**: Each data source must be able to handle errors internally and log them appropriately, providing enough context for debugging and user-friendly messages.\n3. **Timeouts**: We should implement timeouts for data retrieval to avoid blocking the entire system in case one source is too slow.\n4. **Retries**: For transient errors (like network issues), retries can help recover from temporary failures without failing the entire system.\n5. **Logging**: Errors and performance metrics should be logged to help with monitoring and alerting.\n\n### Approach:\n\n1. **`ITransactionSource` Interface**: The interface will define a contract that all data sources must follow.\n2. **Error Handling**: Use a combination of exception handling, timeouts, retries, and logging.\n3. **Fallback Mechanism**: If one source fails, the system should either skip the source, try it again later, or fall back to another data source.\n4. **Timeouts and Retries**: Use appropriate timeouts for data fetching and retry strategies for transient failures.\n\n### Implementation Outline:\n\n1. **`ITransactionSource` Interface**:\n   This interface will define a method `GetTransactions()` which must be implemented by each data source.\n\n2. **Implementing `ITransactionSource`**:\n   Each specific data source (e.g., database, message queue, REST API) will implement the `GetTransactions()` method, and include error handling for timeouts, network failures, and retries.\n\n3. **Error Handling Strategy**:\n\n   * Use **try-catch** blocks for exceptions.\n   * Use **timeouts** to avoid hanging indefinitely on slow or unresponsive data sources.\n   * Implement **retry logic** with an exponential backoff strategy for transient failures (e.g., network issues).\n   * Log errors with meaningful messages.\n\n### Example Code:\n\n```python\nimport time\nimport logging\nimport random\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Transaction:\n    def __init__(self, id: int, amount: float):\n        self.id = id\n        self.amount = amount\n\nclass ITransactionSource:\n    def GetTransactions(self) -> List[Transaction]:\n        pass\n\nclass DatabaseTransactionSource(ITransactionSource):\n    def GetTransactions(self) -> List[Transaction]:\n        # Simulate potential network error or delay\n        if random.random() < 0.2:  # Simulating a 20% chance of failure\n            raise TimeoutError(\"Database connection timed out\")\n        return [Transaction(1, 100.0), Transaction(2, 200.0)]  # Mock data\n\nclass APISource(ITransactionSource):\n    def GetTransactions(self) -> List[Transaction]:\n        # Simulate potential API failure\n        if random.random() < 0.3:  # Simulating a 30% chance of failure\n            raise ConnectionError(\"Failed to connect to API\")\n        return [Transaction(3, 300.0), Transaction(4, 400.0)]  # Mock data\n\nclass TransactionService:\n    def __init__(self, sources: List[ITransactionSource]):\n        self.sources = sources\n\n    def GetAllTransactions(self) -> List[Transaction]:\n        all_transactions = []\n        for source in self.sources:\n            try:\n                transactions = self._fetch_transactions_from_source(source)\n                all_transactions.extend(transactions)\n            except Exception as e:\n                logging.error(f\"Error retrieving transactions from {source.__class__.__name__}: {e}\")\n        return all_transactions\n\n    def _fetch_transactions_from_source(self, source: ITransactionSource) -> List[Transaction]:\n        retries = 3\n        timeout = 5  # Timeout in seconds\n        for attempt in range(retries):\n            try:\n                transactions = source.GetTransactions()\n                return transactions\n            except (TimeoutError, ConnectionError) as e:\n                logging.warning(f\"Attempt {attempt + 1} failed for {source.__class__.__name__}: {e}\")\n                if attempt < retries - 1:\n                    time.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff\n                else:\n                    raise e\n            except Exception as e:\n                logging.error(f\"Unexpected error from {source.__class__.__name__}: {e}\")\n                raise e\n        return []\n\n# Example usage:\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)\n\ndatabase_source = DatabaseTransactionSource()\napi_source = APISource()\n\nservice = TransactionService([database_source, api_source])\ntransactions = service.GetAllTransactions()\n\nfor transaction in transactions:\n    print(f\"Transaction {transaction.id}: ${transaction.amount}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **`ITransactionSource` Interface**: This is the base interface that defines the `GetTransactions()` method. Every data source will implement this method to fetch transactions in a different way (e.g., from a database, API, or message queue).\n\n2. **`TransactionService`**: This is the main service responsible for fetching transactions from multiple sources. It handles retry logic, timeouts, and logging.\n\n3. **Retry Logic**:\n\n   * The method `_fetch_transactions_from_source` attempts to retrieve transactions from a source up to `3` times (with exponential backoff) if there are temporary failures like network issues or timeouts. If all retries fail, it raises the error.\n   * This ensures the system doesn't hang or crash when a source is temporarily unavailable.\n\n4. **Error Handling**: Errors like `TimeoutError` and `ConnectionError` are caught and logged. For other unexpected errors, they are also logged with more details.\n\n5. **Logging**: We use Python's `logging` module to log errors and warnings. This is helpful for monitoring and debugging.\n\n6. **Exponential Backoff**: If the data source is temporarily unavailable, the system retries the request with an exponential delay (`2^attempt`), which helps avoid overwhelming the server.\n\n### Key Features:\n\n* **Resilience**: If one data source fails, the system doesn't fail entirely. It continues to process transactions from other sources.\n* **Error Handling**: Errors are logged, and retries are performed for transient failures (e.g., network timeouts).\n* **Performance**: Exponential backoff and retries reduce the likelihood of overwhelming the system with requests when there are intermittent failures.\n* **Scalability**: The system can easily scale by adding more sources (e.g., more APIs, databases) as needed.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThis design ensures that the system is resilient, handles errors gracefully, and provides valuable feedback to both users and developers through logging. It also uses best practices like retries, timeouts, and exponential backoff to ensure that temporary failures don't affect the overall system performance.\n",

      "feedback": "The answer is well-structured, clear, and demonstrates a good understanding of the problem and its potential solutions. The design considerations are well-articulated, and the implementation outline provides a solid foundation. The example code is helpful and illustrates the concepts effectively. The explanation of key features is also very well done. However, there are a few areas where the answer could be improved, specifically around the design of the `Transaction` object and the handling of different error types more generically. Also, while the example uses timeouts and retries, it lacks a configuration mechanism for these parameters, which is essential for real-world scenarios.",
