      "content": "You are building a system for detecting duplicate files on a large file server. Due to the size of the server, comparing files directly is computationally expensive. Design an algorithm using hashing to efficiently identify potential duplicate files. The algorithm should prioritize speed and minimizing false negatives (missing actual duplicates), but can tolerate a reasonable number of false positives (identifying non-duplicates as duplicates). Consider the trade-offs involved in choosing a hashing algorithm and handling collisions. Your algorithm should work even if the files are not exactly the same byte-for-byte (e.g., different metadata or slightly modified timestamps). What hash function would you choose, and how would you handle potential collisions?",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "How would you scale your solution to handle petabytes of data?",
