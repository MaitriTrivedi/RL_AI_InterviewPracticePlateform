      "difficulty": 9.0,
      "content": "You are designing a distributed cache system that needs to handle a massive influx of requests (millions per second). You've chosen to implement consistent hashing with virtual nodes to distribute keys across a cluster of cache servers. However, you anticipate that some keys will be significantly more popular than others, leading to hotspots on specific servers. Design a self-adjusting consistent hashing algorithm that dynamically re-assigns virtual nodes to servers based on observed access patterns, aiming for uniform load distribution while minimizing disruption to the cache. Consider the following constraints:\n\n*   **Minimal Data Migration:** Re-assignments should aim to minimize the amount of data that needs to be migrated between servers.\n*   **Low Overhead:** The monitoring and adjustment process must not significantly impact the overall throughput and latency of the cache.\n*   **Fault Tolerance:** The system should gracefully handle server failures during the re-assignment process.\n\nSpecifically, describe the data structures, algorithms, and mechanisms you would use to:\n\n1.  Monitor key access patterns and identify potential hotspots.\n2.  Determine which virtual nodes to re-assign and to which servers.\n3.  Migrate data associated with the re-assigned virtual nodes with minimal disruption.\n4.  Handle server failures gracefully during re-assignment and ensure data consistency.",

As such, the response demonstrates no understanding of consistent hashing, dynamic load balancing, data migration techniques, or fault tolerance mechanisms in the context of a distributed cache. There is no demonstration of data structures, algorithms, or strategies for addressing the problem. The response offers no insights into the practical application of the concepts or performance overhead considerations.",
