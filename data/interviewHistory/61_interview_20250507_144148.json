      "subtopic": "DNS/DHCP",
      "difficulty": 8.304480837821984,
      "content": "You are designing a highly available and secure DHCP and DNS infrastructure for a global SaaS provider. The provider has geographically distributed data centers, each with a significant number of clients dynamically assigned IP addresses. A recent surge in sophisticated DNS spoofing and DHCP starvation attacks has prompted the need for robust defenses. Describe your design, focusing on the following aspects:\n\n1.  **DHCP:** Implement DHCPv6 with Prefix Delegation. Explain how you would design the DHCP server architecture to handle failover and load balancing across multiple data centers. Consider how you would prevent rogue DHCP servers from poisoning the network. Detail your strategy for DHCP lease time management, considering both IPv4 and IPv6, to mitigate address exhaustion attacks while optimizing address reuse. Explain how to enforce strict client authentication and authorization before granting IP addresses.\n\n2.  **DNS:** Design a DNS architecture utilizing DNSSEC, Response Rate Limiting (RRL), and DNS Cookies to protect against DNS-based attacks. Explain how you would handle zone transfers securely between your authoritative name servers, which are also geographically distributed. Your design should address both primary and secondary DNS server redundancy. Describe how you will manage the Key Signing Key (KSK) and Zone Signing Key (ZSK) rollover process to minimize disruption to DNS resolution. Discuss your strategy for dealing with DNS amplification attacks. Explain how you would implement split-horizon DNS to provide different DNS views for internal and external clients.\n\n3.  **Integration & Monitoring:** How will you integrate DHCP and DNS to automatically update DNS records when IP addresses are assigned or changed, including PTR records? What monitoring and alerting mechanisms would you implement to detect and respond to DHCP exhaustion attacks, DNS spoofing attempts, or other anomalies in the DHCP/DNS infrastructure?",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "How would your design change if the SaaS provider needed to support legacy devices that only support DHCPv4 and do not support DNSSEC?",
        "What specific security tools (e.g., firewall rules, intrusion detection systems) would you utilize in conjunction with DHCP/DNS to enhance security?",
        "How would you handle the situation where a client moves frequently between different data centers, potentially receiving different IP address ranges? What are the implications for DNS and how would you address them?"

This demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of the concepts of DHCP, DNS, DNSSEC, and related security measures. The response lacks any technical accuracy, completeness, clarity, or practical application. The prompt requested a detailed architectural design and security strategy, all of which are absent.",
