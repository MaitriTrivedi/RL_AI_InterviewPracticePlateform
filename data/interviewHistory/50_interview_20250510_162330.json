      "content": "Imagine you have a large table of customer data with millions of rows, and you frequently need to look up customers by their 'last_name'. Explain in simple terms what an index on the 'last_name' column would do, and how it could help improve the speed of these lookups. Provide a real-world analogy to help illustrate your explanation.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "What is a potential downside to having too many indexes on a table?",

        "Index is a data structure that speeds up data retrieval.",
        "Index helps avoid full table scans by creating a faster lookup mechanism.",

      "feedback": "The answer provided is simply a sequence of numbers and does not address the prompt at all. It demonstrates no understanding of indexing or its application to database performance. The answer fails to explain the concept of an index, its benefits, or provide a relevant analogy. There is a complete lack of technical accuracy, completeness, clarity, and practical application.",
