      "content": "Imagine you are building a simple notification system. Currently, it only sends email notifications. You need to add support for sending SMS notifications as well. How would you use polymorphism to design this system so that adding more notification types in the future is easy and doesn't require modifying existing code? Provide a basic class diagram or code snippet (in any language) to illustrate your approach.",

    "answer": "To design the notification system with **polymorphism** so that adding more notification types (like SMS, Push, etc.) in the future is easy and doesn't require modifying existing code, we can utilize the **Strategy Design Pattern**.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n* We will create a **`Notification`** interface with a method `send()` that can be implemented by different notification types (like `EmailNotification`, `SMSNotification`, etc.).\n* This allows us to easily add new notification types by simply creating new classes that implement the `Notification` interface without changing the existing system.\n* The client can interact with the `Notification` interface, which provides flexibility and extensibility.\n\n### Class Design:\n\n1. **`Notification` Interface**: Defines the `send()` method that each notification type must implement.\n2. **`EmailNotification` Class**: Implements the `Notification` interface for email notifications.\n3. **`SMSNotification` Class**: Implements the `Notification` interface for SMS notifications.\n4. **`NotificationService` Class**: Uses polymorphism to handle notifications without knowing the exact type of notification.\n\n### Code Snippet (in Java):\n\n```java\n// The Notification interface\npublic interface Notification {\n    void send(String message, String recipient);\n}\n\n// EmailNotification implementation\npublic class EmailNotification implements Notification {\n    @Override\n    public void send(String message, String recipient) {\n        System.out.println(\"Sending Email to \" + recipient + \": \" + message);\n    }\n}\n\n// SMSNotification implementation\npublic class SMSNotification implements Notification {\n    @Override\n    public void send(String message, String recipient) {\n        System.out.println(\"Sending SMS to \" + recipient + \": \" + message);\n    }\n}\n\n// NotificationService class using polymorphism\npublic class NotificationService {\n    private Notification notification;\n\n    // Constructor accepts any Notification type\n    public NotificationService(Notification notification) {\n        this.notification = notification;\n    }\n\n    // Delegate the notification sending to the respective notification type\n    public void sendNotification(String message, String recipient) {\n        notification.send(message, recipient);\n    }\n}\n\n// Main class to test the polymorphic behavior\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Using EmailNotification\n        Notification email = new EmailNotification();\n        NotificationService emailService = new NotificationService(email);\n        emailService.sendNotification(\"Hello, this is an email!\", \"user@example.com\");\n\n        // Using SMSNotification\n        Notification sms = new SMSNotification();\n        NotificationService smsService = new NotificationService(sms);\n        smsService.sendNotification(\"Hello, this is an SMS!\", \"123-456-7890\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n* **Polymorphism** is achieved because both `EmailNotification` and `SMSNotification` implement the `Notification` interface, and we can treat both as `Notification` objects.\n* **Extensibility**: To add a new notification type, we just need to create a new class implementing the `Notification` interface. The rest of the code remains unchanged.\n\n### Benefits:\n\n* **Separation of concerns**: Each notification type (email, SMS, etc.) has its own class that handles the specific logic for sending messages.\n* **Scalability**: Adding new notification types (like Push Notifications) is easy, just by implementing the `Notification` interface without modifying existing code.\n",

      "score": 9,
      "feedback": "The answer is excellent. The student clearly understands polymorphism and its application in designing a flexible notification system. The use of the Strategy pattern (although not explicitly required by the question, it's a good fit) is well-explained. The provided code is clean, functional, and effectively demonstrates the core concepts. The explanation is thorough and covers the benefits of this design. The separation of concerns and scalability aspects are also highlighted, which is great. The answer addresses all evaluation points and provides a comprehensive solution.",
      "strengths": [
        "Correct and efficient use of polymorphism.",
        "Well-structured code with clear class definitions and interfaces.",
        "Excellent explanation of the design and its benefits.",
        "Accurate implementation of the Strategy pattern in this context.",
        "Provides a working code example in Java."
      ],
      "areas_for_improvement": [
        "While the Strategy pattern works, simply using an interface and injecting different implementations into a single service could be slightly simpler. Mentioning this as an alternative approach (even if briefly) could show a broader understanding.",
        "Error handling could be added to the `send()` methods to make the solution more robust. For instance, logging a failure or throwing an exception if the notification fails to send."
      ],
      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Discuss other design patterns that could be used to solve this problem, such as the Observer pattern (if the NotificationService needs to notify multiple listeners).",
        "How would you handle different configuration requirements for each notification type (e.g., API keys for SMS, SMTP settings for email)? Consider dependency injection or a factory pattern."
