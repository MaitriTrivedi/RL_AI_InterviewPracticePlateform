    "answer": "Load balancing is a technique used to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers instead of letting a single server handle everything. Think of it like a traffic cop who directs cars (website visitors) to different lanes (servers) to avoid one lane (server) getting clogged and causing a jam (website crash or slowdowns).\n\nHow Load Balancing Helps:\nWhen your website gets a lot more traffic than usual, a single server might struggle to keep up, leading to slow response times or even crashing. Load balancing ensures that the traffic is spread out evenly across multiple servers. This way, no single server becomes overloaded, and the website can handle more visitors smoothly, improving both performance and reliability.\n\nIn simple terms, load balancing makes sure your website doesn\u2019t get bogged down by too many people trying to access it at once. Instead of putting all the pressure on one server, it shares that pressure across several servers, keeping everything running smoothly even when traffic spikes.\n",
    "evaluation": {
      "score": 9,
      "feedback": "The answer is excellent. It provides a clear and concise explanation of load balancing and its benefits in the context of increased website traffic. The analogy of a traffic cop effectively illustrates the concept of distributing traffic across multiple servers. The explanation highlights the prevention of server overload and website downtime, as well as the improvement of website performance and responsiveness. The answer demonstrates a good understanding of the core concepts.",

        "Clear and concise explanation using an easy-to-understand analogy.",

      "areas_for_improvement": [
        "Could briefly mention different types of load balancing algorithms (e.g., round robin, least connections) for a more comprehensive answer, though this is not strictly necessary at this level.",
        "Could mention horizontal scaling as an enabler alongside load balancing, showing how the servers being balanced are added as needed."
      ],
      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Explain different load balancing algorithms (e.g., round robin, least connections) and when you might use each.",
        "Discuss how load balancing integrates with horizontal scaling to handle varying traffic loads."
