      "difficulty": 4.0,
      "content": "You are building a simple application to manage different types of vehicles. Currently, you only need to manage `Car` and `Truck` objects. Both cars and trucks have attributes like `make`, `model`, and `year`. They also both have a method called `get_description()` that returns a string describing the vehicle. Implement the classes `Vehicle`, `Car`, and `Truck`. The `Vehicle` class should serve as the base class, and `Car` and `Truck` should inherit from it. `get_description()` should be implemented in the base class and customized slightly in the derived classes. For a car, the description should be \"[Year] [Make] [Model] (Car)\", and for a truck, it should be \"[Year] [Make] [Model] (Truck)\".",

    "evaluation": {
      "score": 8,
      "feedback": "The solution correctly implements inheritance, initializes attributes in the base class constructor, and overrides the `get_description()` method in the derived classes. The code is functional and addresses the core requirements of the problem. However, the code can be improved by leveraging the base class's `get_description` method in the derived classes, instead of rewriting the entire string formatting. This promotes code reuse and reduces redundancy, making the code more maintainable. The solution demonstrates an understanding of polymorphism through method overriding.",

        "Correct inheritance implementation.",
        "Proper use of constructor in the base class.",

        "Code redundancy in `get_description()` methods of `Car` and `Truck`.",
        "Lack of code reuse: Derived classes should leverage the base class's `get_description()` method."
      ],
      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Refactor the `Car` and `Truck` classes to call the base class's `get_description()` method and then append the additional string '(Car)' or '(Truck)'. For example, in the `Car` class's `get_description()` method, use `return super().get_description() + ' (Car)'`.",
        "Consider discussing different ways to achieve polymorphism and the benefits of each approach (e.g., abstract base classes)."
