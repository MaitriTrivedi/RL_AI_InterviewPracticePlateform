      "topic": "os",
      "subtopic": "Deadlocks",
      "difficulty": 2.4,
      "content": "Imagine you have two threads, Thread A and Thread B. Thread A needs resource X and then resource Y to complete its task. Thread B needs resource Y and then resource X. Can you explain how a deadlock could occur in this scenario? What is the fundamental condition that leads to this deadlock?",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "In simple terms, what does it mean for a thread to 'hold' a resource?",
        "Can you give a real-world example, outside of computing, that illustrates the concept of a deadlock?"
      ],
      "evaluation_points": [
        "Mutual exclusion - resources are non-shareable",
        "Hold and wait - a thread holds a resource while waiting for another",
        "Circular wait - a chain of threads waiting for each other's resources",
        "No preemption - resources cannot be forcibly taken away"
      ],
      "expected_time_minutes": 5
    },
    "answer": "A **deadlock** could occur if **Thread A** acquires **resource X** and waits for **resource Y**, while **Thread B** acquires **resource Y** and waits for **resource X**. Both threads are now blocked, waiting for the resource held by the other, resulting in a circular dependency where neither thread can proceed.\n\nThe fundamental condition leading to this deadlock is the **circular wait** \u2014 each thread holds one resource and waits for the other, creating a cycle that prevents both threads from making progress.\n",
    "evaluation": {
      "score": 7,
      "feedback": "The answer correctly identifies the deadlock scenario and mentions circular wait as a contributing factor. However, it only highlights one of the four necessary conditions for deadlock. While circular wait is present and explained well, the answer would be stronger by explicitly mentioning and explaining the other three conditions: mutual exclusion, hold and wait, and no preemption. By elaborating on these conditions, the answer would demonstrate a more complete understanding of the underlying causes of deadlock.",
      "strengths": [
        "Correctly identifies the deadlock scenario with two threads and two resources.",
        "Clearly explains the circular wait condition in the given context."
      ],
      "areas_for_improvement": [
        "Fails to explicitly mention and explain all four necessary conditions for deadlock (mutual exclusion, hold and wait, no preemption, and circular wait).",
        "Could benefit from a more detailed explanation of how each of the four conditions contributes to the deadlock."
      ],
      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Explain how mutual exclusion applies in this scenario. What prevents multiple threads from using resource X or Y simultaneously?",
        "Explain how \"hold and wait\" is demonstrated in the given scenario.",
        "Explain the implications of \"no preemption\" in this specific deadlock situation.",
        "Can you suggest a solution to prevent this deadlock scenario, addressing one or more of the four conditions?"
