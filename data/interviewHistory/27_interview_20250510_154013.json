      "content": "Imagine you're building a simple recommendation system for movies. You have a list of movies, and each movie belongs to one or more genres (e.g., Comedy, Action, Drama). Given a target list of genres the user likes (e.g., ['Comedy', 'Action']), and a number 'k', your task is to find *any* combination of *k* movies such that *all* target genres are represented at least once in that combination. For example:\n\nmovies = {\n 'Movie A': ['Comedy', 'Action'],\n 'Movie B': ['Drama', 'Romance'],\n 'Movie C': ['Action', 'Sci-Fi'],\n 'Movie D': ['Comedy', 'Thriller']\n}\n\ntarget_genres = ['Comedy', 'Action']\nk = 2\n\nOne possible solution would be ['Movie A', 'Movie D'] because they satisfy the Comedy and Action criteria. \n\nImplement a function `find_movie_combination(movies, target_genres, k)` that returns *one* valid combination of *k* movies (a list of movie names) that covers all the target genres, or an empty list if no such combination exists. You can represent the movie genre information using a dictionary as shown above.",

    },
    "answer": "To implement the function find_movie_combination(movies, target_genres, k), the goal is to select a combination of k movies such that all the target genres are represented at least once. We can approach this problem by iterating through different combinations of movies, checking if they cover all the target genres.\n\nApproach:\nMovie and Genre Mapping: Each movie is associated with a list of genres. The target genres are a list of genres the user likes, and we need to find movies that cover these genres.\n\nCombination Selection: We will try all combinations of k movies from the list of available movies.\n\nChecking for Genre Coverage: For each combination, check if the selected movies cover all the target genres.\n\nReturn Result: If a valid combination is found, return the combination of movies; otherwise, return an empty list.\n\nPlan:\nFirst, generate all possible combinations of k movies.\n\nFor each combination, check if it covers all the target genres by collecting the genres of the movies in that combination and ensuring that the target genres are all present.\n\n",
    "evaluation": {
      "score": 6,
      "feedback": "The answer outlines a correct high-level approach using combination generation and genre coverage checking. However, it lacks crucial details about the implementation of the backtracking algorithm that's expected for this kind of problem. It mentions 'trying all combinations,' but doesn't specify *how* these combinations are generated, and doesn't clearly articulate the recursive nature of backtracking. The explanation of the genre coverage check is also superficial; it needs more detail on how to collect and check for genre presence. While the high-level plan is sound, the lack of specific implementation details, especially considering backtracking was explicitly requested, reduces the score.",
