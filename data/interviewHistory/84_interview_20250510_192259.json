      "content": "You are designing an API endpoint `/videos/{video_id}/comments` which allows clients to retrieve comments for a specific video. Currently, the system supports around 1000 requests per second (RPS). The product team anticipates a viral video campaign that could potentially increase traffic to 10,000 RPS within a few hours. Describe how you would optimize the API's performance and scalability to handle this anticipated surge in traffic, focusing on caching strategies, database considerations, and API design choices. What are the trade-offs you would consider?",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "What metrics would you monitor to ensure the effectiveness of your optimizations, and what would be considered acceptable thresholds?",
        "How would your caching strategy differ if the comments are real-time and users can add new comments frequently?",
        "How would you handle eventual consistency issues if using a distributed caching system?"

    "answer": "To optimize the `/videos/{video_id}/comments` API for scalability and performance, especially with the anticipated surge in traffic:\n\n1. **Caching Strategy:**\n\n   * **Implement a CDN** (Content Delivery Network) and **cache comment data** at the edge for frequently accessed videos. Cache results for a short period (e.g., 5\u201310 minutes).\n   * Use an **in-memory cache** like **Redis** to cache recent or hot video comments (especially for viral videos) and serve them directly to users without hitting the database.\n\n2. **Database Considerations:**\n\n   * Use **database sharding** to distribute comments across multiple databases based on `video_id` to balance the load.\n   * Implement **read replicas** to handle high read traffic efficiently, especially for popular videos.\n   * Use **pagination** and **limit the number of comments** returned per request (e.g., 50 per request) to reduce the load on the database.\n\n3. **API Design:**\n\n   * **Rate limit** the API to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.\n   * **Batch requests** for comments (e.g., allow clients to request multiple videos\u2019 comments at once).\n   * Optimize query performance by **denormalizing** comment counts or summary data to avoid expensive JOIN operations.\n\n**Trade-offs:**\n\n* Caching adds complexity in terms of invalidation when new comments are added.\n* Pagination and rate limiting might reduce user experience by limiting data, but they are essential for handling the load.\n",

      "feedback": "The answer provides a good overview of strategies for optimizing the `/videos/{video_id}/comments` API. The caching strategies, database considerations, and API design choices are generally well-explained. The trade-offs section is a bit brief but identifies some key considerations. The answer demonstrates a good understanding of the problem and potential solutions. However, it could benefit from more detail in certain areas, especially regarding specific implementations and monitoring/alerting.",
      "strengths": [
        "Identifies appropriate caching layers (CDN, in-memory cache).",
        "Suggests relevant database optimizations (sharding, read replicas).",
        "Includes important API design considerations (pagination, rate limiting).",
        "Mentions the complexity introduced by caching and the potential impact of pagination/rate limiting on user experience."
      ],
      "areas_for_improvement": [
        "The caching section could elaborate on cache invalidation strategies beyond just mentioning the complexity. Consider strategies like time-to-live (TTL), event-driven invalidation, or using a message queue.",
        "The database section could benefit from discussing indexing strategies for the comments table and how to optimize queries for retrieving comments for a specific video. Also, clarify the sharding key choice beyond just `video_id`, considering potential hot spots if some videos become much more popular than others. Consistent hashing or range-based sharding could be explored.",
        "The API design section could be more specific about rate limiting strategies (e.g., token bucket, leaky bucket) and how they would be implemented. Also, the 'batch requests' idea is not well-suited for retrieving comments for single video. Consider more relevant API optimisation such as partial responses using field selection, or optimized serialization formats.",
        "The trade-offs section lacks a discussion of consistency versus availability. How important is it to show the latest comments immediately, or can the system tolerate some delay? Also, there is no mention of cost implications related to these choices (e.g., CDN costs, database infrastructure costs).",
        "The response is missing mention of monitoring and alerting. How would you monitor the API's performance and identify potential issues? What metrics would you track (e.g., request latency, error rate, database load)? What alerts would you set up to notify the team of problems?"

      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Describe different cache invalidation strategies and their implications.",

        "Consider consistency versus availability trade-offs in the context of comment retrieval.",
