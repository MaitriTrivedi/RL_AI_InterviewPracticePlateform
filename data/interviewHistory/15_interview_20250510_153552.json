      "difficulty": 3.4499999999999997,
      "content": "Imagine you're designing a simple social media application where users post short text updates. The core requirement is to ensure that all users see a consistent view of these posts. Given the CAP theorem, if you prioritize Consistency and Availability during a network partition, what specific strategies or trade-offs would you employ to achieve this? Provide a practical example illustrating how a user might experience this trade-off.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "How might your strategy change if your application scaled dramatically and the frequency of network partitions increased?",
        "What are some potential monitoring strategies you could use to detect and respond to network partitions in a timely manner?"

        "Understanding of CP systems: Sacrifice Availability to maintain Consistency during partitions.",
        "Strategies like locking, two-phase commit, or distributed consensus algorithms.",

      "feedback": "The answer 'acnkasc' provides no meaningful information related to the question. It demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of the CAP theorem, Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance, or strategies for implementing CP systems in a distributed environment. The answer doesn't address any aspect of the question, including strategies, trade-offs, or practical examples.",

        "Ability to provide practical examples illustrating the trade-offs involved in prioritizing Consistency over Availability."
      ],
      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Study the CAP theorem and its different tradeoffs (CA, AP, CP). Focus on understanding the definition of consistency and availability in the context of the CAP theorem.",
        "Research distributed consensus algorithms like Paxos or Raft, and how they guarantee consistency even during network partitions. Consider simpler approaches like locking mechanisms and two-phase commit.",
        "Practice explaining these concepts in your own words and providing concrete examples of how they affect user experience. For example, think about what would happen if a user tries to post an update during a partition in a CP system."
