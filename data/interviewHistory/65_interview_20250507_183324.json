      "content": "You are designing a rate limiting service for a video streaming platform.  The platform needs to rate limit based on both user ID and IP address to prevent abuse (e.g., a single user creating many accounts to bypass limits or an attacker spamming requests from multiple IPs). The rate limit configuration is dynamic, meaning the allowed requests per minute (RPM) for a given user or IP can change based on various factors, such as subscription tier or detected malicious activity.  Specifically, the system needs to support two separate rate limits:  User-based RPM and IP-based RPM. If a request exceeds either limit, it should be rejected.\n\nDescribe a scalable and fault-tolerant architecture for this rate limiting service.  Focus on the data structures and algorithms you would use to efficiently store and check the request counts for both user IDs and IP addresses. Assume the platform experiences a high volume of requests, and latency is critical.  How would you handle updating rate limit configurations (RPM values) dynamically without impacting performance?",

    "answer": "To build a scalable and fault-tolerant rate limiting service for a high-volume video streaming platform, I would use a **distributed, in-memory caching system** like **Redis** to store request counts and rate limits for both user IDs and IP addresses.\n\n### Architecture:\n\n1. **Data Structures**:\n\n   * Use **Redis Hashes** to store request counts for each user and IP, where the keys are user ID or IP address, and the values are counters tracking requests in the current time window.\n   * Implement **Sliding Window** or **Fixed Window Counters** in Redis using **timestamps** to track the number of requests in a specific time period (e.g., 1 minute).\n   * For dynamic rate limits, store configurable RPM values for user tiers and IPs in a **Redis set or sorted set** to easily retrieve and update the allowed RPM.\n\n2. **Rate Limiting Logic**:\n\n   * When a request comes in, first check the corresponding user or IP\u2019s request count in Redis.\n   * If the count exceeds the allowed RPM for either user or IP, reject the request.\n   * Use Redis' **atomic operations** (e.g., `INCR` and `EXPIRE`) to ensure concurrent request handling without race conditions.\n\n3. **Dynamic Configuration Updates**:\n\n   * Store rate limit configurations in **Redis** or a **distributed key-value store** like **Consul** to update RPM values in real-time without affecting ongoing requests.\n   * Use a **pub/sub system** (e.g., Redis Pub/Sub) to notify service instances of any rate limit changes, allowing them to refresh their local configuration.\n\n4. **Fault Tolerance**:\n\n   * **Replication** and **sharding** in Redis ensure high availability and fault tolerance. If one Redis instance fails, a replica can take over with minimal impact.\n   * **Cache expiry** for request counts ensures old data is automatically purged, keeping memory usage efficient.\n\nThis architecture allows high throughput, low-latency checks, and efficient updates to rate limit configurations in real time, while handling both user-based and IP-based rate limits.\n",

      "feedback": "The answer provides a reasonable high-level architecture for a rate limiting service. The use of Redis is appropriate and the explanation of data structures is generally sound. However, the answer lacks depth in several key areas, particularly concerning the specifics of implementing sliding window counters, distributed rate limiting strategies beyond basic sharding, and fault tolerance beyond replication. The dynamic configuration update section is also somewhat superficial. The answer correctly identifies the need for atomic operations but doesn't fully elaborate on how Redis Lua scripts could be used to achieve true atomicity across multiple operations, especially for more complex rate limiting scenarios.",
