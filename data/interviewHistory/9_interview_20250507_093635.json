      "difficulty": 5.0,
      "content": "Imagine you are building a web application that displays trending news articles. The same articles are requested frequently by many users within a short period (e.g., 5 minutes). To improve performance and reduce load on your database, you decide to implement caching. Describe your approach for implementing a simple in-memory cache for these articles. Consider what data structure you might use, how you would handle cache invalidation (specifically, how would you ensure the cache doesn't serve stale articles), and what trade-offs are involved.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "What are the advantages and disadvantages of using an in-memory cache compared to other caching strategies like using a distributed cache (e.g., Redis or Memcached)?",
        "How would you handle a scenario where the cache becomes full? What eviction policy (e.g., Least Recently Used - LRU) could you employ?"

      "evaluation_points": [
        "Use of a Dictionary or Map data structure for key-value pairs (article ID, article content).",

      "feedback": "The candidate indicated they did not know the answer. This demonstrates a lack of understanding of basic caching concepts, data structures, and cache invalidation strategies. There is no evidence of any technical knowledge, completeness, or clarity in the response. Furthermore, there's no demonstration of how the concepts could be applied in a practical setting. Consequently, no points are awarded.",
