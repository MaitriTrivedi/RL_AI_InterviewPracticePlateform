      "difficulty": 4.1572257875811065,
      "content": "You are working with a database that stores information about customer orders. Two tables are relevant: `Customers` (CustomerID, CustomerName, City) and `Orders` (OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate, TotalAmount).  You need to generate a report listing each city and the total amount spent by customers in that city during the last year (2023). However, you only need to include cities where the total amount spent is greater than $10,000. Write a SQL query to achieve this.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "How would you optimize this query if the `Orders` table contained millions of records and performance was critical?",
        "Could you write a different version of the query that achieves the same result, perhaps using a subquery?"
      ],
      "evaluation_points": [
        "Use of JOIN to combine data from Customers and Orders tables.",
        "Filtering by date to only include orders from 2023 (or the last year dynamically).",

      "feedback": "The candidate stated they don't know the answer. This indicates a lack of understanding of basic SQL concepts such as JOINs, aggregation, date filtering, and the HAVING clause. The answer demonstrates no effort towards problem-solving or attempting to construct a query, even partially.",
