    "answer": "To design a URL shortening service that can handle growth from 1,000 to 100,000 daily users, the architecture must be scalable, reliable, and performant. Here's a simple design that can handle this increasing load:\n\n### 1. **Basic Architecture (for 1,000 daily users)**:\n\n* **Frontend (Web Server)**: A lightweight web server (e.g., Nginx or Apache) serves as the entry point for users. It handles HTTP requests for shortening URLs, redirects, and status pages.\n* **Application Server**: A backend server (e.g., using Node.js, Python, or Ruby) that handles the core logic, such as URL shortening, redirection, and generating unique short URLs.\n* **Database**: A relational database (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL) stores mappings between short URLs and original URLs. A simple table with columns like `id`, `short_url`, and `original_url` is sufficient.\n\n### 2. **Scalability Considerations (for 100,000 daily users)**:\n\n* **Horizontal Scaling**:\n\n  * Use **load balancers** to distribute incoming requests evenly across multiple application servers.\n  * The database can be scaled by **read replicas** to handle increasing read traffic (for redirections). The write traffic (for generating short URLs) can be handled by the primary database.\n\n* **Caching Layer**:\n\n  * Use a **caching layer** (e.g., Redis or Memcached) to cache the most frequently accessed short URLs and their corresponding original URLs. This reduces the database load and speeds up redirection.\n\n* **URL Shortening Algorithm**:\n\n  * Instead of using a sequential integer to generate short URLs, use a **hashing mechanism** (like Base62 encoding) to ensure uniqueness and avoid database bottlenecks.\n\n* **Asynchronous Task Queue**:\n\n  * For background tasks like analytics or logging, implement an **asynchronous task queue** (e.g., RabbitMQ or Celery) to avoid blocking user-facing processes.\n\n* **Database Sharding**:\n\n  * As the database grows, consider **sharding** the database based on ranges of short URL IDs or hashes. This distributes the load and improves query performance.\n\n* **Storage Optimization**:\n\n  * If the original URLs are large (e.g., long URLs or metadata), use a separate object storage system (like Amazon S3) to store URLs and only store the metadata in the relational database.\n\n### 3. **Reliability and Fault Tolerance**:\n\n* **Replication & Backup**: Use **database replication** to ensure high availability. Regular backups can be scheduled to prevent data loss.\n* **Monitoring & Auto-Scaling**: Use **monitoring** tools (like Prometheus or Datadog) to track performance, errors, and system load. Set up **auto-scaling** for application servers based on traffic volume.\n\n### 4. **Optional Advanced Features (for future growth)**:\n\n* **Analytics & Logging**: Track usage stats such as the number of clicks for each short URL and the geographic location of users. This can be stored in a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB) for fast access.\n* **API**: Provide a public API for users to create short URLs programmatically.\n\nThis architecture ensures that the system remains performant and scalable as the user base grows from 1,000 to 100,000 daily users, while also being easy to maintain and expand as the service scales further.\n",

      "feedback": "The response provides a well-structured and comprehensive architecture for the URL shortening service, addressing both initial setup and scalability concerns. It covers essential components like web servers, application servers, databases, load balancing, caching, and database sharding. The explanation of each component and its role in scaling is clear. The response also touches upon reliability, fault tolerance, and optional advanced features like analytics and API. However, some aspects could be further elaborated, and the practical application could be strengthened with concrete examples.",

        "The explanation of the URL shortening algorithm could be more detailed. While Base62 is mentioned, a more specific description of how it maps to unique short URLs and handles collisions would be beneficial.",
        "The explanation of database sharding could be expanded with details on different sharding strategies (e.g., range-based, hash-based) and their trade-offs. Also, the student could consider the impact of re-sharding when the data grows.",
        "The practical application of monitoring could be enhanced by specifying which metrics to monitor (e.g., request latency, error rates, CPU utilization, memory usage) and how these metrics would trigger auto-scaling or other interventions.",
        "The response only mentions a relational database initially. Justification for sticking with SQL as the service scales, as opposed to NoSQL for faster short link generation could be elaborated, particularly in relation to scaling writes."
