    "answer": "### Problem Overview:\n\nIn this problem, we need to determine the **shortest delivery route** from a central depot (source node) to a specified delivery location (destination node) in a **directed acyclic graph (DAG)**. Each node represents a location, and each edge between nodes represents the travel time (a positive weight).\n\nGiven that the graph is acyclic, we can exploit this property to optimize the shortest path calculation. **Dijkstra's algorithm** would work well for general graphs, but we can improve efficiency using an algorithm more suited for DAGs.\n\n### Optimal Approach: **Topological Sorting + Relaxation**\n\nSince the graph is **directed** and **acyclic**, we can perform the shortest path search more efficiently by utilizing **topological sorting** followed by a **single pass relaxation**. Here's why:\n\n* In a **DAG**, there is a **linear ordering** of the nodes such that for every directed edge (u \u2192 v), node u comes before v in the ordering.\n* This ordering means that once we process a node, all of its descendants (nodes reachable via directed edges) have already been processed, allowing us to perform the relaxation of edges in a simple, efficient manner.\n\n### Approach:\n\n1. **Topologically sort the nodes** in the graph. This gives a linear order of nodes such that for any edge (u \u2192 v), u will appear before v.\n2. **Relax edges** in topological order. For each node, update the shortest path to its neighbors based on the current shortest path.\n\n### Algorithm:\n\n1. **Topological Sort**: Perform a topological sort of the DAG. This can be done in **O(V + E)** time using Depth-First Search (DFS) or Kahn's algorithm (queue-based).\n2. **Relaxation**: For each node in the topologically sorted order, relax its outgoing edges, updating the shortest path to each adjacent node.\n\n### Detailed Steps:\n\n1. Initialize a **distance array** with the source node's distance set to 0 and all other nodes set to infinity (`\u221e`).\n2. Perform **topological sorting** of the graph.\n3. Iterate over each node in the sorted order. For each node:\n\n   * For each outgoing edge (u \u2192 v) from that node, update the distance of v if a shorter path via u is found.\n4. After processing all nodes, the shortest path to the destination node will be available in the distance array.\n\n### Python Code (Implementation):\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Function to perform a topological sort\ndef topological_sort(graph, n):\n    in_degree = [0] * n\n    for u in range(n):\n        for v in graph[u]:\n            in_degree[v] += 1\n    \n    # Queue to process nodes with zero in-degree\n    queue = deque()\n    for i in range(n):\n        if in_degree[i] == 0:\n            queue.append(i)\n    \n    topo_order = []\n    while queue:\n        node = queue.popleft()\n        topo_order.append(node)\n        \n        for neighbor in graph[node]:\n            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1\n            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:\n                queue.append(neighbor)\n    \n    return topo_order\n\n# Function to find the shortest path using topological sort and relaxation\ndef shortest_path_dag(graph, source, destination, n):\n    topo_order = topological_sort(graph, n)\n    \n    # Initialize distances with infinity, except for the source\n    dist = [float('inf')] * n\n    dist[source] = 0\n    \n    # Relax the edges based on topological order\n    for node in topo_order:\n        if dist[node] != float('inf'):\n            for neighbor, weight in graph[node]:\n                if dist[neighbor] > dist[node] + weight:\n                    dist[neighbor] = dist[node] + weight\n    \n    # Return the shortest distance to the destination node\n    return dist[destination]\n\n# Example Usage:\n# graph represented as adjacency list where each node points to a list of (neighbor, weight)\n# Example: graph[u] = [(v1, weight1), (v2, weight2), ...]\n\ngraph = {\n    0: [(1, 2), (2, 4)],\n    1: [(3, 7)],\n    2: [(3, 1)],\n    3: []\n}\n\nsource = 0\ndestination = 3\nn = len(graph)\n\n# Output the shortest travel time from source to destination\nresult = shortest_path_dag(graph, source, destination, n)\nprint(f\"The shortest travel time is: {result}\")\n```\n\n### Time Complexity:\n\n* **Topological Sort**: O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.\n* **Relaxation (Relaxing all edges)**: O(E) since each edge is relaxed once.\n\nTherefore, the overall time complexity of this approach is **O(V + E)**, which is much more efficient than **O(V \\* log V + E)** in Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm, especially when dealing with DAGs.\n\n### Why This Approach is More Efficient for DAGs:\n\n* **Dijkstra\u2019s Algorithm** typically requires maintaining a priority queue, which has a time complexity of **O(log V)** per operation. This makes it less efficient when compared to a **topological sort-based approach** for DAGs.\n* In a **DAG**, the topological sort ensures we process nodes in an optimal order, where we can perform a single pass relaxation of all edges in linear time. This avoids the overhead of managing a priority queue, making the solution faster for acyclic graphs.\n\n### Summary:\n\nBy utilizing **topological sorting** followed by **edge relaxation**, we can efficiently find the shortest path in a **DAG**, achieving a time complexity of **O(V + E)**. This approach is more efficient than Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm for this specific case because of the absence of cycles and the deterministic processing order provided by topological sorting.\n",
