The current code looks like this (assume it compiles and basic email functionality is implemented):\n\n```java\npublic class NotificationService {\n\n    public void sendNotification(String message, String recipientEmail) {\n        // Send email logic here\n        System.out.println(\"Sending email to \" + recipientEmail + \": \" + message);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe business now wants to add support for SMS notifications and push notifications to the mobile app. Explain how you would modify the `NotificationService` class to accommodate these new notification types while adhering to the SOLID principles. Specifically, identify which SOLID principles are being violated by the current design and how you would address them.

    "answer": "To accommodate new notification types (SMS and push notifications) while adhering to the **SOLID** principles, we first need to understand the issues with the current design and then refactor it according to the **SOLID** principles.\n\n### 1. **Violations of SOLID Principles in the Current Design**\n\n#### **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**:\n\n* **Violation**: The `NotificationService` class is responsible for both determining what kind of notification to send and how to send it (email, SMS, push, etc.). This violates SRP because the class has multiple responsibilities: managing the notification types and implementing their sending logic.\n\n#### **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**:\n\n* **Violation**: The current design doesn't allow easy extension. If we want to add a new notification type (SMS, push notifications, etc.), we would need to modify the `NotificationService` class, which violates the **Open/Closed Principle**. The class should be open for extension but closed for modification.\n\n#### **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**:\n\n* **Violation**: The `NotificationService` class directly depends on the concrete logic for sending emails. According to DIP, high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.\n\n### 2. **Proposed Solution**\n\nThe goal is to refactor the code so that it adheres to the SOLID principles and makes it easy to add new notification types without modifying existing code.\n\n#### **Step 1: Define an Interface for Notifications (Abstraction)**\n\nWe will start by creating a `NotificationSender` interface, which will define the contract for all notification types.\n\n```java\npublic interface NotificationSender {\n    void sendNotification(String message, String recipient);\n}\n```\n\n#### **Step 2: Implement Concrete Classes for Each Notification Type**\n\nNext, we will implement concrete classes for email, SMS, and push notifications. Each class will implement the `NotificationSender` interface.\n\n```java\npublic class EmailNotificationSender implements NotificationSender {\n    @Override\n    public void sendNotification(String message, String recipient) {\n        // Email sending logic\n        System.out.println(\"Sending email to \" + recipient + \": \" + message);\n    }\n}\n\npublic class SMSNotificationSender implements NotificationSender {\n    @Override\n    public void sendNotification(String message, String recipient) {\n        // SMS sending logic\n        System.out.println(\"Sending SMS to \" + recipient + \": \" + message);\n    }\n}\n\npublic class PushNotificationSender implements NotificationSender {\n    @Override\n    public void sendNotification(String message, String recipient) {\n        // Push notification sending logic\n        System.out.println(\"Sending Push Notification to \" + recipient + \": \" + message);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### **Step 3: Refactor the Notification Service to Use Dependency Injection**\n\nWe will refactor the `NotificationService` class to depend on the `NotificationSender` abstraction. The `NotificationService` class should not directly create instances of specific notification types but should rather accept them via **Dependency Injection (DI)**. This way, we can inject different types of notification senders without modifying the `NotificationService` class.\n\n```java\npublic class NotificationService {\n\n    private NotificationSender notificationSender;\n\n    // Constructor injection for Dependency Injection\n    public NotificationService(NotificationSender notificationSender) {\n        this.notificationSender = notificationSender;\n    }\n\n    public void sendNotification(String message, String recipient) {\n        notificationSender.sendNotification(message, recipient);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### **Step 4: Extending the System with New Notification Types**\n\nNow, if we want to add a new notification type (for example, **FaxNotificationSender**), we only need to implement the `NotificationSender` interface in a new class. We don't need to modify existing classes, which adheres to the **Open/Closed Principle**.\n\n```java\npublic class FaxNotificationSender implements NotificationSender {\n    @Override\n    public void sendNotification(String message, String recipient) {\n        // Fax sending logic\n        System.out.println(\"Sending Fax to \" + recipient + \": \" + message);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### **Step 5: Using the NotificationService with Different Notification Types**\n\nFinally, we can use the `NotificationService` with different notification types by simply passing the appropriate implementation of `NotificationSender`:\n\n```java\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Sending Email\n        NotificationService emailService = new NotificationService(new EmailNotificationSender());\n        emailService.sendNotification(\"Your order has been shipped!\", \"customer@example.com\");\n\n        // Sending SMS\n        NotificationService smsService = new NotificationService(new SMSNotificationSender());\n        smsService.sendNotification(\"Your order has been shipped!\", \"123-456-7890\");\n\n        // Sending Push Notification\n        NotificationService pushService = new NotificationService(new PushNotificationSender());\n        pushService.sendNotification(\"Your order has been shipped!\", \"userDevice123\");\n\n        // Sending Fax (Example of adding a new type)\n        NotificationService faxService = new NotificationService(new FaxNotificationSender());\n        faxService.sendNotification(\"Your order has been shipped!\", \"fax123\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 3. **SOLID Principles Addressed in the Refactored Design**\n\n* **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**:\n\n  * Each class has one responsibility: each notification type handles its own specific logic for sending notifications. The `NotificationService` only handles the orchestration of sending notifications using different senders, adhering to SRP.\n\n* **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**:\n\n  * The system is open for extension (new notification types can be added by creating new `NotificationSender` implementations) but closed for modification (we don't need to modify the existing classes when adding a new notification type).\n\n* **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**:\n\n  * All concrete `NotificationSender` classes can be substituted for each other without affecting the correctness of the program. They all implement the same interface and provide the same method `sendNotification`.\n\n* **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**:\n\n  * The `NotificationSender` interface is focused on a single purpose: sending notifications. Clients only need to know about this single method and don\u2019t have to deal with unrelated methods, adhering to ISP.\n\n* **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**:\n\n  * The `NotificationService` class depends on the `NotificationSender` interface, not on concrete classes. The concrete implementation is injected, which allows for more flexibility and better testing.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy refactoring the `NotificationService` class and using the **SOLID** principles:\n\n* We've made the code extensible by using an interface for all notification types.\n* We've removed direct dependencies on specific notification types, allowing us to easily add new ones without modifying existing code.\n* The system is now **open for extension** but **closed for modification**, ensuring better maintainability and scalability.\n",

        "While LSP is mentioned, it could be slightly more elaborated on within the context of the e-commerce notification system. Specifically, mentioning that any future notification senders will behave in a manner consistent with expectations based on the NotificationSender interface, thereby upholding LSP, would make the answer stronger."
