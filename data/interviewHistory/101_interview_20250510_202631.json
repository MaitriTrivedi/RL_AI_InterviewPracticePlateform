    "answer": "**Stack**: Think of a stack of plates. Plates are added to the top, and when you need one, you take the top plate. This follows the **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** principle \u2014 the last plate added is the first one to be removed.\n\n**Queue**: Imagine a line at a grocery store. People join the line at the back, and the person at the front of the line is served first. This follows the **FIFO (First In, First Out)** principle \u2014 the first person to enter the line is the first to leave.\n\nIn summary:\n\n* **Stack**: LIFO \u2014 \"Last In, First Out\" (plates).\n* **Queue**: FIFO \u2014 \"First In, First Out\" (grocery line).\n",

      "feedback": "The answer is excellent. It clearly and accurately explains the difference between a Stack and a Queue using appropriate analogies. The LIFO and FIFO principles are correctly identified and related to the examples. The explanation is easy to understand and comprehensive, addressing all key aspects of the question. Minor improvement could be to explicitly mention terms like 'push' and 'pop' for the stack and 'enqueue' and 'dequeue' for the queue, to show a slightly more technical understanding.",

        "Explain how Stacks and Queues are implemented using arrays or linked lists.",
