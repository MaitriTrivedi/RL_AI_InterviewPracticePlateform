      "difficulty": 9.319561967481432,
      "content": "Design a highly scalable and available solution for storing and querying financial transaction data using a distributed NoSQL database. Assume you are building a real-time fraud detection system that needs to analyze transactions as they occur. Specifically, consider these requirements:\n\n*   High ingest rate: Millions of transactions per second.\n*   Low latency queries: Must identify fraudulent transactions in milliseconds.\n*   Complex analytical queries: Need to perform aggregations and statistical analysis on transaction history, such as identifying unusual spending patterns for a user or globally.\n*   Data consistency: Transactions must be durably stored, but eventual consistency is acceptable for historical analytical queries.\n*   Data retention: Store transaction data for 5 years, with more frequent access required for recent data.\n*   Data schema evolution: The transaction data format may evolve over time with new fields being added.\n\nDescribe your NoSQL database choice (e.g., Cassandra, DynamoDB, Cosmos DB), data model, sharding strategy, indexing strategy, and read/write optimization techniques. How would you handle data schema evolution, manage data retention and archiving, and ensure both low-latency real-time fraud detection and efficient historical analytical queries, considering trade-offs between consistency, latency, and cost? How would you address the 'hot partition' problem if a particular user becomes exceedingly popular or is targeted by fraudulent activity?",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "How would you monitor and alert on performance bottlenecks or data skew in your system?",
        "Describe the recovery process in case of node failure in your chosen NoSQL database. How would you ensure minimal downtime?",

      "score": 0,
      "feedback": "The answer provided 'don't know the answer' indicates a complete lack of knowledge regarding the question. There's no attempt to address any aspect of the problem, including NoSQL database selection, data modeling, sharding, indexing, optimization, schema evolution, data retention, hot partition handling, or the trade-offs between consistency, latency, and cost. The response fails to demonstrate understanding of the core concepts required to design a scalable and available solution for financial transaction data storage and querying. Given the multi-faceted nature of the problem and the complete absence of any relevant information, the score is 0.",
