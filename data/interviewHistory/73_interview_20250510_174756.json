      "subtopic": "Scalability",
      "difficulty": 4.1,
      "content": "Imagine you are building a simple URL shortener service. When a user submits a long URL, your service generates a shorter, unique URL (e.g., bit.ly/xyz123). Initially, you expect a small number of users. However, you anticipate significant growth and need to design the service to handle a rapidly increasing number of URL shortening requests. Describe the simplest, most scalable approach you would take to ensure the service can handle a large influx of incoming URL shortening requests, focusing specifically on the database architecture for storing URL mappings. Consider using a NoSQL database and explain your reasoning. How would you handle the potential for write contention if multiple requests try to generate shortened URLs simultaneously?",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "What are some advantages and disadvantages of using a relational database (like PostgreSQL or MySQL) instead of a NoSQL database in this scenario?",
        "How could you improve read performance for URL redirection lookups (i.e., when a user clicks on a shortened URL)?",
        "What is the difference between horizontal and vertical scaling, and which approach is generally more suitable for this type of application?"
      ],
      "evaluation_points": [
        "Understanding of basic NoSQL database concepts (e.g., key-value stores, document databases).",
        "Recognition of the read/write characteristics of a URL shortener (many reads, moderate writes).",
        "Awareness of potential write contention and basic solutions (e.g., pre-generation of short URLs, UUIDs).",
        "Understanding that scalability focuses on increasing the capacity of the URL shortening service"

      "score": 0,
      "feedback": "The candidate stated \"I don't know\", indicating a lack of understanding of the problem and potential solutions. This demonstrates no knowledge of NoSQL databases, scalability considerations, or handling write contention. The candidate did not provide any insights into database architecture, URL shortening service design, or concurrency control. Therefore, no aspects of the question were addressed, indicating a complete lack of preparation or knowledge on the subject.",
