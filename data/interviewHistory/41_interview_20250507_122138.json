      "content": "Consider a large-scale distributed system for processing financial transactions. Each transaction type (e.g., stock trade, wire transfer, credit card purchase) requires different validation rules, security protocols, and logging formats. To manage this complexity, a base `Transaction` class is defined with abstract methods for `validate`, `process`, and `log`. Each transaction type then inherits from this base class and implements these methods accordingly. Now, imagine a scenario where a new regulatory requirement mandates a pre-processing step involving complex data masking and encryption *before* the `validate` method is invoked for *certain* transaction types (e.g., wire transfers and credit card purchases involving international transfers). This pre-processing logic is highly sensitive and requires access to a secure hardware security module (HSM) accessible only via a specific API.\n\nDiscuss how you would design and implement this pre-processing requirement leveraging polymorphism, while adhering to the following constraints:\n\n1.  Minimize code duplication across transaction type implementations.\n2.  Maintain the existing polymorphic structure of the `Transaction` class hierarchy.\n3.  Ensure high performance, considering the latency associated with the HSM interaction. The HSM interaction should ideally occur only when necessary.\n4.  Provide a mechanism to dynamically enable/disable the pre-processing step for specific transaction types without requiring code changes or redeployments of individual transaction implementations.\n5.  Consider how your solution would handle error scenarios during the HSM interaction, and how you would gracefully degrade if the HSM is temporarily unavailable.",

        "What are the trade-offs between using inheritance and composition in this scenario, and how would you defend your chosen approach?"
