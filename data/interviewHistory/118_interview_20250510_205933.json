      "difficulty": 4.092048564192471,
      "content": "Imagine you are developing a simple memory manager for embedded systems with limited RAM. This memory manager uses a fixed-size block allocation strategy (a memory pool). You have a function `allocate_block()` that returns a pointer to a free block if available, otherwise returns `NULL`. You also have a `release_block(void *block)` function that marks a block as free. However, your system is experiencing occasional crashes due to double frees. Describe how you would implement a simple error handling mechanism to detect and prevent double frees within your `release_block()` function. Provide a conceptual outline of your approach. You do not need to provide actual code, but should explain the data structures and logic involved. Consider the performance overhead of your solution.",

        "What are the trade-offs between this simple error handling and more complex memory management techniques?",
