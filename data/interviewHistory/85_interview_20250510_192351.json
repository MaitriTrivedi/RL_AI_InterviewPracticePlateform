      "content": "You are designing a database for an online course platform. Initially, all course information (course ID, course name, instructor ID, instructor name, instructor email, and course description) is stored in a single table named `Courses`. This leads to significant data redundancy because the instructor's information is repeated for every course they teach. \n\n1.  Describe the normalization steps you would take to eliminate redundancy and improve data integrity. Be specific about the normal forms you are aiming for (e.g., 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF) and how each step addresses the specific redundancies in the `Courses` table.\n2.  After normalizing, what tables would you end up with, and what would be the primary and foreign keys in each table?\n3.  Briefly explain one potential drawback of normalization and how you might address it in this specific scenario.",

        "How would you handle a scenario where an instructor can have multiple email addresses?",

    "answer": "1. **Normalization Steps:**\n\n   * **1NF (First Normal Form)**: Ensure all columns have atomic values. If `instructor_name` and `instructor_email` are stored in a single column, split them into separate columns.\n   * **2NF (Second Normal Form)**: Remove partial dependencies. The instructor's information (name, email) is dependent on `instructor_id`, not on the `course_id`. So, we create a separate `Instructors` table.\n   * **3NF (Third Normal Form)**: Remove transitive dependencies. `Instructor name` and `email` are only dependent on `instructor_id`, not on `course_id`. Thus, the instructor information should be in its own table, and courses should only store the `instructor_id` as a foreign key.\n\n2. **Normalized Tables:**\n\n   * **Courses**: `course_id` (PK), `course_name`, `instructor_id` (FK), `course_description`\n   * **Instructors**: `instructor_id` (PK), `instructor_name`, `instructor_email`\n\n   **Primary and Foreign Keys:**\n\n   * **Courses**: `course_id` (PK), `instructor_id` (FK referencing `Instructors.instructor_id`)\n   * **Instructors**: `instructor_id` (PK)\n\n3. **Drawback of Normalization**:\n\n   * **Performance Impact**: Normalization can lead to complex joins and slower queries, especially when retrieving course information with instructor details.\n   * **Solution**: Introduce **denormalization** where necessary, such as caching frequently accessed data or using materialized views for performance optimization.\n",

      "feedback": "The answer is very good and demonstrates a strong understanding of database normalization. The explanation of each normal form is clear and accurate, and the resulting table structure is well-defined with appropriate primary and foreign keys. The student also correctly identifies a potential drawback of normalization (performance impact) and suggests reasonable mitigation strategies. The minor suggestion relates to a more explicit initial state description and a deeper discussion on other potential denormalization options.",
