      "subtopic": "CPU Scheduling",
      "difficulty": 4.0,
      "content": "Imagine you are designing a simple task scheduler for a microcontroller in a coffee machine. The microcontroller needs to handle two tasks: brewing the coffee (Task A) and displaying the current time on an LCD screen (Task B). Brewing coffee is more critical and should have priority. Describe how you would implement a preemptive priority scheduling algorithm to manage these two tasks. Explain the basic steps your scheduler would take to ensure the coffee brews reliably while still updating the display periodically. Assume Task A takes a relatively long time (several seconds) and Task B takes a very short time (few milliseconds).",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "What could be a potential issue with only using preemption (e.g., priority inversion), and how could you mitigate it in this scenario?",
        "How often would you update the display (Task B) given the coffee brewing task (Task A) taking a long time? Justify your choice in terms of user experience and resource usage."
