    "answer": "**TCP Congestion Control Mechanisms:**\n\nWhen a user experiences slower internet speeds due to network congestion, TCP uses **congestion control** to dynamically adjust its transmission rate to avoid overwhelming the network. The two key phases involved in this process are **Slow Start** and **Congestion Avoidance**.\n\n1. **Slow Start Phase**:\n\n   * When a TCP connection is first established or after a timeout, it starts with a small **congestion window (cwnd)**, usually 1 or 2 segments. The idea is to slowly probe the network to determine the maximum amount of data it can send before causing congestion.\n   * In this phase, for every acknowledgment (ACK) received, the **cwnd** doubles. This exponential growth helps quickly find the network's capacity but also risks sudden congestion.\n   * For example, if the initial **cwnd** is 1 segment, after the first round-trip (RTT), it increases to 2, then to 4, and so on, rapidly increasing the sending rate.\n\n2. **Congestion Avoidance Phase**:\n\n   * Once the **cwnd** reaches a threshold (called **ssthresh**), the connection enters the **Congestion Avoidance** phase. Here, instead of doubling the **cwnd**, it increases linearly, typically by 1 segment per RTT. This helps prevent congestion from increasing too quickly.\n   * For example, if **ssthresh** is 8 segments, once the **cwnd** surpasses this value, it grows from 8 to 9, then 10, etc., at a much slower, controlled rate.\n\n**Simplified Example:**\n\nLet\u2019s assume an initial **cwnd** of 1 segment and a **ssthresh** of 8 segments.\n\n* **Slow Start**:\n\n  * **cwnd** = 1 \u2192 2 \u2192 4 \u2192 8 (doubling each RTT)\n* **Congestion Avoidance** (after reaching **ssthresh**):\n\n  * **cwnd** = 8 \u2192 9 \u2192 10 \u2192 11 (linear increase per RTT)\n\n**How This Helps**:\n\n* In **Slow Start**, the **cwnd** quickly increases, allowing for fast data transfer once the network's capacity is probed.\n* In **Congestion Avoidance**, the increase is slower, avoiding congestion by allowing the sender to adjust more carefully to network conditions.\n\nBy dynamically adjusting the sending rate, these mechanisms help **TCP** avoid overwhelming the network, ensuring a more stable download speed and reducing packet loss due to congestion.\n",

      "feedback": "The answer provides a solid explanation of TCP congestion control, specifically slow start and congestion avoidance. It correctly describes how the congestion window (cwnd) changes during each phase and how ssthresh is used. The simplified example is helpful for understanding the concept. However, the answer could be improved by explicitly mentioning how packet loss affects the cwnd and ssthresh. It could also benefit from mentioning the multiplicative decrease phase after a packet loss event to ensure a comprehensive understanding of TCP congestion control.",
