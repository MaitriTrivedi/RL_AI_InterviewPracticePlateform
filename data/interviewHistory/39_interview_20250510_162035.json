      "difficulty": 4.6,
      "content": "You are designing a system to cache frequently accessed product details on an e-commerce website. The product catalog contains millions of products, but only a small percentage (say, 5%) are frequently viewed. You've implemented a basic in-memory cache using a Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction policy. However, during peak hours, your cache is experiencing frequent evictions, leading to a high cache miss rate and increased database load. How would you optimize your caching strategy to reduce the eviction rate and improve the overall system performance?",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "What are the trade-offs between different cache eviction policies (e.g., LRU, LFU, FIFO)? Which might be more suitable in this scenario, and why?",
        "How can you monitor the effectiveness of your caching strategy? What metrics would you track?"
      ],
      "evaluation_points": [
        "Understanding of LRU eviction policy and its limitations.",
        "Knowledge of alternative eviction policies and their applicability (e.g., LFU may be better for skewed access patterns).",
        "Importance of monitoring cache hit rate, miss rate, and eviction rate.",
        "Consideration of cache size and its impact on performance.",
        "Potential solutions: increase cache size, implement LFU or other appropriate eviction policy, consider a two-level caching strategy (e.g., L1 and L2 cache)."

      "score": 0,
      "feedback": "The candidate stated that they do not know. This indicates a complete lack of understanding of caching strategies and eviction policies, and therefore, no ability to analyze the problem or propose solutions. The answer demonstrates no understanding of basic caching concepts or troubleshooting techniques for performance issues in a caching system. There is no practical application demonstrated.",

      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Study common caching strategies and eviction policies (LRU, LFU, FIFO, etc.). Understand their strengths and weaknesses in different scenarios.",
        "Research how to monitor and analyze cache performance metrics (e.g., using monitoring tools or logging).",
        "Practice applying caching techniques to different problem scenarios, such as caching frequently accessed data in web applications or API responses.",
        "Explore the concept of multi-level caching and its benefits."
