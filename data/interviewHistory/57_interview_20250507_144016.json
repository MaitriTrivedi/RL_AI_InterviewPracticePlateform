      "topic": "system_design",
      "subtopic": "Rate Limiting",
      "difficulty": 10.0,
      "content": "Design a globally distributed, eventually consistent rate limiting service for a social media platform experiencing viral spikes. The platform allows users to post, like, and comment. Assume a global user base and a need to handle sustained rates of 1 million requests per second, with bursts potentially exceeding 10x that. The rate limiter must prevent abuse and ensure fair usage. Your design should specifically address the challenges of minimizing latency for global users while maintaining consistency across geographically dispersed datacenters. Focus on a multi-layered approach that optimizes for cost, performance, and fault tolerance, and explain how you would handle a situation where a datacenter becomes completely unavailable. Consider both client-side and server-side rate limiting strategies and how they interact. Provide justifications for your technology choices and data structures, including the rationale behind eventual consistency and how you would mitigate its potential drawbacks.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "How would you monitor the effectiveness of your rate limiting system and detect potential attacks that circumvent your rules?",
        "Describe the trade-offs between different consistency models (e.g., strong vs. eventual consistency) in this scenario and why you chose the specific approach.",
