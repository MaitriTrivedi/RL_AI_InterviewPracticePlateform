      "difficulty": 3.5,
      "content": "You're setting up a simple web application with two identical servers behind a load balancer. You want to ensure that if one server fails, the other server automatically takes over without users experiencing any interruption. Which load balancing algorithm would be most suitable for this scenario and why? Explain how this algorithm contributes to fault tolerance in this specific setup.",
      "follow_up_questions": [
        "Besides the algorithm you mentioned, can you name another load balancing algorithm that could also contribute to fault tolerance, albeit perhaps less directly in this simple scenario?",
        "What is a potential drawback of using the algorithm you chose, in a situation where server capacity is not identical?"
      ],
      "evaluation_points": [
        "Understanding of basic load balancing algorithms (e.g., Round Robin, Least Connections, Health Checks based)",
        "Ability to relate load balancing algorithms to fault tolerance",
        "Recognizing the importance of Health Checks in ensuring server availability",
        "Explanation should address the scenario provided and not just generic definitions."

      "feedback": "The candidate stated they don't know the answer. This indicates a lack of understanding of fundamental load balancing concepts and their application in ensuring fault tolerance for web applications. The answer provides no information to evaluate based on technical accuracy, completeness, clarity, or practical application.",
