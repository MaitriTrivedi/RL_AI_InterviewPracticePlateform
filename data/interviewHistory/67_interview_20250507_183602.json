      "content": "You are developing a resource management system for a cloud provider. This system manages virtual machine (VM) instances and network resources (IP addresses). Each VM requires both a VM instance and an IP address to be considered successfully provisioned. Two separate threads, `Thread A` and `Thread B`, are responsible for provisioning these resources. `Thread A` attempts to acquire a VM instance first and then an IP address, while `Thread B` attempts to acquire an IP address first and then a VM instance. This is simplified, but in real systems, resource management is far more complex. \n\nExplain how a deadlock could occur in this scenario. Describe at least two practical strategies you could implement to prevent this deadlock from happening. Your solution should aim to maximize resource utilization and minimize the impact on provisioning performance. Focus on the high-level design and algorithmic approach rather than specific code implementation details.",

        "How would your chosen deadlock prevention strategies affect the overall system performance, especially under high load?",

    },
    "answer": "A **deadlock** could occur in this scenario if `Thread A` acquires the VM instance and then waits for the IP address, while `Thread B` acquires the IP address and waits for the VM instance. Both threads are now blocked, waiting for the resource held by the other, resulting in a deadlock.\n\n### Strategies to Prevent Deadlock:\n\n1. **Lock Ordering**:\n\n   * Ensure that both threads always acquire resources in the same order (e.g., VM instance first, then IP address). This eliminates the circular wait condition, a key requirement for deadlock.\n\n2. **Timeout and Retry**:\n\n   * Implement a timeout mechanism where if a thread cannot acquire both resources within a certain time frame, it releases any acquired resources and retries. This approach prevents threads from being indefinitely blocked, ensuring progress.\n\nBoth strategies ensure resource utilization is maximized while minimizing delays and deadlock risks.\n",

      "score": 7,
      "feedback": "The answer correctly identifies the deadlock scenario and provides two reasonable strategies to prevent it. The explanation of lock ordering is clear and accurate. However, the explanation of the timeout and retry strategy could be more detailed, specifically regarding the trade-offs involved (e.g., starvation, wasted resources during retry). The answer lacks a deeper discussion of alternative strategies, such as pre-allocation or deadlock detection/recovery, even though the question primarily focused on prevention. Also, the justification for maximizing resource utilization and minimizing delays could be more substantial. A more nuanced discussion of the pros and cons of each strategy in the specific context would improve the answer.",
